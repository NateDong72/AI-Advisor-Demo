In the matter of the trading in 
Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Corp Ltd (“AIM”)  
 
With respect to the actions of  
Vincent Tan Kim Yong (“Vincent”)  
 
Expert Opinion Report 
 
 
Dear Madam, 
 
Please accept this letter as my considered opinion to the questions posed under your Terms 
of Reference received by myself on [7 May 2008] with respect to S197(1)(b) of the Securities 
and Futures Act (chapter 289, 2002 Revised Edition). 
 
Background 
 
1. Glossary and Facts provided to myself and used in this report: 
 
a. “AIM” or “the Company” means Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Corp Ltd 
an electronics manufacturing services provider, specializing in medium and 
high-end application for aerospace-avionics, medical, life sciences, data 
storage, semi-conductor and fiber optics  industries and which was listed on 
the SGX main board on 26 May 2005 with an initial public offering price of 
$0.20;  
 
b. “Teo” shall mean Mrs. Teo Siew Ling, the wife of Vincent; 
 
c. “Intraday Price” means the change in the price between the day’s opening 
price and the day’s closing price during the Relevant Period.  For example on 
the 27/3/2006 the opening price of the Shares was 33 cents and the closing 
price was 36 cents.  The Intraday price was thus 3 cents.  Note the opening 
 
12 
 
 
price is not necessarily the same as the previous day’s closing price.  The 
closing price of the 26/3/2006 was 32.5 cents.  
 
d. “Market Days” means the days on which the Singapore Stock Exchange was 
open for trading; 
 
e. “Relevant Period” means the 15 February 2006 and 31 October 2006 
inclusive; 
 
f. “SESMANU” means the SES Manufacturing Index; 
 
g. “SFA” means Securities and Futures Act (chapter 289, 2002 Revised Edition); 
 
h. “SGX” shall mean the Singapore Exchanged Limited and its subsidiaries the 
Singapore Stock Exchange and the Singapore International Monetary 
Exchange; 
 
i. “Share(s)” or “AIM Shares” means the ordinary, issued and fully paid shares 
of AIM and which are listed on the SGX;  
 
j. “STI” means the Straits Times Index; 
 
k. “Vincent” shall mean Dr. Vincent Tan Kim Yong or Vincent Tan Kim Yong and 
Teo Siew Ling.  Thus when the report speaks of Vincent’s action it means 
either the action of Vincent Tan Kim Yong solely or the actions of Vincent Tan 
Kim Yong and Teo Siew Ling jointly. 
 
l. “74 Days” means the 74 days during the Relevant Period on which Vincent 
executed a trade;  
 
m. One folder of information and further supplementary data by way of e-mail 
and as listed in Appendix 1.   
 
 
 
13 
 
 
Terms of Reference 
 
2. For the period between 15 February 2006 and 31 October 2006, 
 
2.1 Having regard to the prevailing market conditions, 
 
a. What appearance did the orders and trades conducted by Vincent create, 
or were likely to create, with respect to the market for AIM shares? In 
particular, did the orders and trades by Vincent create, or were likely to 
create, a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for AIM 
shares? 
 
b. What appearance did the orders and trades conducted by Vincent create, 
or were likely to create, with respect to the price of AIM shares? In 
particular, did the orders and trades by Vincent create, or were likely to 
create, a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price of AIM 
shares? 
 
2.2 Should you be of the opinion that the orders and trades by Vincent had 
affected the market for and/or price of AIM shares in any way, please give 
your opinion on whether it could be inferred that the orders and trades were 
intentionally carried out to cause such an appearance or effect, and if so, the 
basis of this inference.  
 
In the above analysis, you may assume that the orders and trades in Teo Siew Ling’s 
securities trading account were conducted by Vincent.

Important Notice 
 
3 All my expert opinions rely on one significant assumption - that the trading efficiency 
of the Singapore Stock Market is best described by the ‘semi-strong form’ market 
efficiency theory.  This market theory states that equity markets are generally 
efficient but are not always or wholly efficient.  There are rival theories and they 
include: a ‘strong form’ theory that postulates that stock markets are wholly efficient; 
and a ‘weak form’ theory that postulates that stock markets are wholly inefficient.  In 
a wholly efficient market (‘strong form’) all information is known and thus no action 
undertaken by any person can distort or manipulate the market.  In a wholly 
inefficient market (‘weak form’) very little information is available to, or known by, 
investors.  Thus all actions distort the market significantly.  It is my experience that 
most of my fellow professionals in the finance industry adhere to the semi-strong 
form market efficiency assumption. 
 
4 This expert opinion has been prepared in the knowledge that it may be used in a 
court of law. Not withstanding the fact that this expert opinion was requested by the 
Commercial Affairs Department, I confirm that this expert opinion is independent in 
the sense that the opinions it sets forth have not been influenced by the Commercial 
Affairs Department and has been prepared to assist the Court rather than to support 
the case before me.  I further confirm that I understand my duties as an expert 
witness to the Court and that I have complied with such duties.

Price for the Securities 
 
5 During the Relevant Period there were 185 Market Days, meaning 185 days when 
the SGX was open for trading.  AIM Shares only traded on 146 days out of the 185 
available days, meaning on 39 Market Days during the Relevant Period there were 
no trades in AIM Shares. 
 
6 Of the 146 days that AIM Shares were traded during the Relevant Period, Vincent 
traded on 74 of those days.  Meaning that Vincent traded on 50.6% or just above 
half the number of days AIM Shares was traded during the Relevant Period.  Vincent 
was therefore a very active trader of AIM Shares during the Relevant Period.  
 
7 During the Relevant Period some 79,997,000 Shares were traded.  During the 
Relevant Period Vincent bought 36,878,000 Shares.  During the Relevant Period 
Vincent sold no Shares.  Vincent thus accounted for some 46% of all traded volume. 
Vincent therefore contributed very significantly to the traded volume of, and was a 
very important source of demand for, the Shares during the Relevant Period. 
 
8 During the rest of 2006, being the 75 Market Days of 2006 not within the Relevant 
Period, Vincent bought 8,245,000 Shares.  Meaning that Vincent bought a total of 
45,123,000 Shares in 2006 of which nearly 82% were during the Relevant Period.   
 
9 8 Market days after the start1 of the Relevant Period (being 27 Feb. 2006) and as 
shown on the following page, the price of the Shares started to significantly 
outperform the overall market2 and the industrial sector3 to which AIM belongs.  7 
Market days after the end1 of the Relevant Period (being 10 Nov. 2006) the price of 
the Shares started to significantly underperform the STI and SESMANU indices.   
 
                                                 
1 It is not uncommon for an observable trend to emerge only after a period due to price “inertia”.

Chart 1: The relative performance of AIM Shares vs the market as represented 
by the STI and the industrial sector to which it belongs as represented by the 
SESMANU 
 
 
 
10 During the Relevant Period and more specifically between the 15 May 2006 and 14 
June 2006, the STI and the SESMANU declined by 9% and 14%, respectively.  In 
contrast, and during this period, the price of AIM Shares rose by 3% or 1 cent from 
33 cents to 34 cents. 
 
11 I have reviewed the announcements of AIM for the whole of 2006.  A list of the 
announcements made by AIM is shown in Appendix 3.  
 
11.1 There were only two notable announcements prior to the 27 February 2006 
and the start of the AIM Share price rally.  I do not believe that these 
announcements could have contributed to the price of the Shares 
outperforming so significantly the STI and SESMANU during the period 
described in Point 9 given that:  
 
a. The first announcement on 19 January 2006 was with respect to the 
acquisition of the intellectual property rights to the following lancet 
assembly, safety syringe, safety heel stick & safety scalpel.  In an 
announcement dated 20 January 2006 AIM further announced it was 
unable to judge the likely impact of this acquisition as the inventions were 
new.  Further, and given that AIM’s main products are avionics for the 
aerospace industry it is difficult to see why investors would get very excited 
by ASIM acquiring a mass market low per unit value medical device.

b. The second announcement on the 15 February 2006 is with respect to the 
full year 2005 earnings.  On an pro-forma adjusted basis the net profit 
announced was S$8.5 million down from FY2004’s S$12.1 million.  It is 
also difficult to see why investors would greet such a decline warmly.  
 
11.2 There were only two notable announcements in the 8 weeks leading up to 10 
November 2006 and the start of the AIM Share price decline.  I do not believe 
that these announcements which both occurred on the 10 November 2006 
could have contributed to the price of the Shares underperforming so 
significantly the STI and SESMANU post this date given that: 
 
c. One announcement, in my opinion, was mildly negative and relates to the 
resignation of the COO of AIM.  Unlike many small to medium sized 
companies AIM is relatively rich in management.  It has Vincent who is the 
founder, major shareholder, Executive Chairman and CEO and who has 
a host of degrees and many years experience in the industry.  It has Dr. 
Philip Poh as Group Managing Director and who also has a host of 
degrees and is a specialist in supply chain management.  
  
d. One announcement, in my opinion, was mildly positive and relates to 3rd 
quarter 2006 earnings.  The number showed that 3rd quarter 2006 net 
profit after tax as compared to that of the 3rd quarter 2005 rose by 33.1%.  
However, the cumulative net profit after tax of the first 9 months of 2006 
was still lower than that of the first 9 months of 2005 though the gap had 
declined significantly from the first quarters -39.0% to -7.8%.  
 
12 I have reviewed the announcements of AIM during for 2006 and do not believe that 
these announcements could have contributed to the price of the Shares performing 
so well during the market correction as described in Point 10.  In fact the only 
announcement of note was a negative announcement of the 11 May 2006 and which 
preceded the market correction.  This was the announcement of the 1st quarter 
earnings.  This announcement showed revenues down 6.6%, a sharp gross margin 
decline and net profit after tax down -39.0%. 
 
13 Vincent’s pattern of trading during the Relevant Period was unusual.  Of the 74 Days 
that Vincent traded: 
 
e. On most of these days, Vincent executed the bulk of his day’s trade in the 
afternoon4.  On 64 days, accounting for 87% of the 74 Days, Vincent executed 
50% or more of his trades in the afternoon.  On 53 days, accounting for 71% of 
the 74 Days, Vincent executed the 65% or more of his trades in the afternoon.   
On 30 days, accounting for 40% of the 74 Days, Vincent executed all of his 
                                                 
4 With respect to the volume of Shares Vincent executed, the bulk also took place in the afternoon (about 
60%). 
 
18 
 
 
trades in the afternoon.  Given the size and incidence of Vincent’s trades, it is 
difficult to envisage a situation whereby Vincent’s bias towards afternoon 
trading would not influence the afternoon session price of the Shares, and the 
closing price of the Shares, during the Relevant Period;   
 
Table 2: The pattern of Vincent’s trades on the days that he traded during 
the Relevant Period 
 
 
 
f. On 61 days, or 82% of the 74 Days, Vincent was either the last trade of the day 
or Vincent accounted for the whole or a very significant percentage of the pre-
close5.  Of the 61 days, 39 days did not have pre-close activity. On these days, 
Vincent’s trade was the last trade of the day.  Of the 61 days, 22 days had pre-
close activity. On these days, Vincent’s trades accounted for the whole or a very 
significant percentage of the pre-close trade on these days.  Given the size and 
incidence of Vincent’s trades it is difficult to envisage a situation whereby 
Vincent’s preference for being the last trade of the day or dominating pre-close 
trade would not have influenced the closing price on all of these 61 days during 
the Relevant Period;

*  There was no afternoon or pre-close trade.  Vincent’s trade was the last trade of the 
morning session. 
 
14 The days on which Vincent traded displayed unusual price movements.  The table 
below tracks the Intraday Price, meaning the change in the price between the day’s 
opening price and the day’s closing price during the Relevant Period.  For example, 
the number 23 in the table on the following page means that on 23 days the Intraday 
Price, on the days that Vincent did not trade, experienced no change.   For example, 
the number 19 in the table on the following page means that on 19 days the Intraday 
Price, on the days that Vincent did trade, experienced a +1 cent change.   From this 
table it can be noted that:  
 
a. On the days that Vincent did not trade, the Intraday Price spread was -1 cent to 
+3 cents.  The spread was thus 4 cents or about 12.5% of the average closing 
price of the Share6 price during the Relevant Period.  But on the days that 
                                                 
6 Of about 31.9 cents 
 
110 
 
 
Vincent traded, the Intraday Price spread was -2 cents to +5 cents.  The spread 
was thus 7 cents or a whopping 22% of the average closing price of the Share6 
price during the Relevant Period.   
 
b. The average Intraday Price movement, on the days that Vincent did not trade 
was 0.43 cents.   The average Intraday Price movement, on the days that 
Vincent traded was 1.05 cents or nearly 2.5 times larger.    
  
c. Last but not least, the usual steady state, meaning the median Intraday Price 
change (represented by the 32% backgrounded in yellow in the table below) on 
days that Vincent did not traded was zero (no change).  The most likely 
movement on days that Vincent did not traded (80% being 29% and 32% and 
19%) was + or – 1 cent.  On the other hand, on days that Vincent traded, the 
median Intraday Price change (represented by the 45% backgrounded in yellow 
in the table below) was 1 cent and the most likely movement (82% being 26% 
and 45% and 11%) was + or – 2 cents.

15 Given Points 5 to 14, I am of the opinion that; 
 
a. Vincent was a very significant trader and source of demand for AIM shares 
during the Relevant Period and significant trader and source of demand for AIM 
shares in 2006 as a whole. 
 
b. From the perspective of an ordinary investor, and given the information 
available from AIM in 2006, there was no apparent reason for: (i) the price of 
AIM Shares to significantly outperformed the STI and SESMANU during most 
of the Relevant Period and particularly during 27 Feb. 2006 to 10 Nov. 2006; 
(ii) the price of the Shares to rise when the STI and SESMANU indices fell 
during the market correction of 15 May to 14 June 2006. 
 
c. Vincent’s pattern of trading was unusual.  Vincent favoured trading in the 
afternoon session and was frequently the last trade of the day on days when 
there were no pre-close trades.  Vincent trades frequently dominate pre-close 
trades on days when there were pre-close trades.  It would be difficult to 
envisage a situation where Vincent’s trading pattern would not impact the 
appearance with respect to the price of AIM Shares. 
 
d. On the days that Vincent traded, Vincent’s trades altered the Intraday Price’s 
total, average and median spreads.  Therefore, and on the days during the 
Relevant Period that Vincent traded, Vincent’s trades created a false or 
misleading appearance with respect to the price of AIM Shares. 
 
e. When one investor is such as significant trader of a security, it is inevitable that 
this investor will impact not only the price on the day that he trades but also 
other investor perceptions and thus the price on days which he did not trade.  
Therefore, and on the days during the Relevant Period that Vincent did not

with respect to the price of AIM Shares.

f. Vincent trades during the Relevant Period created, and were likely to create, a 
false or misleading appearance with respect to the price of AIM shares.  
 
 
 
 
Market for the Securities 
 
16 A market can be defined in several ways.  For the purposes of this report I have 
defined a market as a process where securities are bought and sold by various 
parties or persons.  Thus, and at its most basic, a market is simply the sum of the 
price at which quantities of a security has been traded. 
 
Market = sum (price * volume traded) 
 
17 Given Point 16 the following matrix can be derived.  The word impact means the 
impact of Vincent’s action on the price or the traded volume of the Share. 
 
 Impact on Price of 
Share is significant 
Impact on Price of 
Share is material 
Impact on Price of 
Share is not 
significant 
Impact on traded 
volume of Share is

Maybe 
(quadrant 7) 
 
No 
(quadrant 8) 
 
No 
(quadrant 9) 
 
Yes: (quadrants 1, 2 and 3) means orders and trades by Vincent created, or were likely to create, 
a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for AIM Shares. 
 
Maybe: (quadrants 3, 5 and 7) means orders and trades by Vincent may have created a false or 
misleading appearance with respect to the market for AIM Shares. 
 
No: (quadrants 6, 8 and 9) means orders and trades by Vincent did not created, or were unlikely 
to create, a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for AIM Shares. 
 
18 In Point 7 it was noted that Vincent accounted for some 46% of all traded volume 
during the Relevant Period.  Once any investor accounts for more than 30% of a 
day or a period’s trade, it is inevitable that the investor will impact the traded volume 
of the security for that day or period (the “30% Rule”).   
 
19 Besides being significant during that Relevant Period, Vincent’s trades were also 
very significant on select days during the Relevant Period (please see table on 
 
113 
 
 
following page). On 8 of those days Vincent accounted for all the purchases. On 63 
days (being 8 + 55 days) Vincent accounted for 50% or more of the purchases.  On 
69 days (being 8 + 55 + 6 days) Vincent accounted for 30% or more of the 
purchases.  69 days represent 47% or nearly half of the days that AIM Shares were 
traded during the Relevant Period.     
 
Table 5: Vincent’s trades as a percentage of total trades on days that Vincent 
traded during the Relevant Period:  
 
Total Traded Volume Accounted for 
100%  8 
50% to 99.9%  55 
30% to 49.9%  6 
15% to 29.9%  5 
5% to 14.9%  0 
below 5%  0 
  74 
 
20 In Points 9, 10, 13 and 14, I demonstrated that Vincent’s trades significantly affected 
the price of AIM Shares.  Given this and Points 16 to 19, I am of the opinion that: 
  
a. On the 69 days that Vincent accounted for 30% or more of that day’s total 
trades, Vincent would have very significantly impacted the traded volume of 
those days.  Accordingly Vincent’s actions fall into quadrant 1 of Point 17’s 
matrix.  Accordingly I am of the belief that orders and trades by Vincent created 
a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for AIM Shares on 
these 69 days. 
 
b. Vincent accounted for 46% of all trades during the Relevant Period and thus 
was a significant trader of AIM Shares during the Relevant Period.  Accordingly 
Vincent’s actions fall into quadrant 1 of Point 17’s matrix.  When one investor is 
such as significant trader of a security it is inevitable that this investor will impact 
not only the traded volume of that day but also other investor perceptions and 
thus the traded volume of days on which he did not trade.   Accordingly I am of 
the belief that the orders and trades by Vincent were likely to create a false or 
misleading appearance with respect to the market for AIM Shares during the 
whole of the Relevant Period. 
 
 
 
114 
 
 
Intentions of Vincent 
 
21 I have neither spoken to Vincent or Teo nor read any statement made by them.  
Thus my observations below are merely ones based on the data and facts detailed 
in Appendix 1 of this report.    
 
22 Vincent is the major shareholder of AIM.  Vincent as at the 3 Jan. 2006, or on the 
first Market Day of 2006, owned 480,671,528 Shares or about 73.3% of the total 
outstanding share capital of AIM. 
 
23 AIM was listed on the 26 May 2005 or just under 9 months prior to the start of 
Vincent’s first purchase on the 16 Feb. 2006 and the Relevant Period. 
 
24 During the Relevant Period, the cumulative holding of Vincent rose as follows: 
 
Chart 6: Cumulative Holdings of Vincent during the Relative Period 
 
  
 
 
25 The sharp rise in Vincent’s holding was unusual given that:  
 
a. When Vincent started buying the Shares, AIM had not been listed a year.  Less 
than 9 months previously AIM debuted at an IPO price of 20 cents.  But yet by 31 
Mar. 2006 Vincent felt it was reasonable pay an average price of 35.5 cents or 
77% more than the IPO price for 1,205,000 Shares (highest average paid price).    
 
b. The announcements that I had reviewed did not suggest that the market had 
incorrectly discounted or was ignoring any significant news.  A review of the 2007 
Annual Report (post balance sheet test) reaffirms my opinion that the market had 
not missed any major trends with respect to AIM or its industry.

Vincent's holding in AIM

Year Net Profit after Tax 
2003 S$6.2m

2006 S$6.2m 
2007 S$4.1m 
 
 
c. The market and investors generally view negatively those securities whose 
liquidity is low.  Vincent’s actions reduced the number of shares that he did not 
own from around 175.1 million Shares at the start of the Relevant Period to 140.1 
million Shares at the end of the Relevant Period.  This is a 5.4 percentage point, 
or nearly 20% reduction (!!), in the free float.  
 
d. The market and investors generally view negatively those securities whose major 
shareholder or senior managers are selling the security.  As Vincent is both a 
major shareholder and the most senior manager, any selling he may undertake 
could undermine AIM’s Share price.  Meaning Vincent could not have been buying 
the shares for trading purposes. 
 
26 One common reason why a major shareholder would acquire significantly more 
shares in his own company is if he believed that the company was significantly 
undervalued by the market.  Vincent must have thought that his company was 
reasonably valued, or at least not significantly undervalued, at 20 cents or he would 
not have agreed to IPO at that price.  There were no disclosed information that 
would suggest that the company was being significantly undervalued at the start of 
2006 and that 35.5 cents, the highest average price that Vincent paid, was the ‘right’ 
price.  A post event analysis, namely of a review of the 2007 Annual Report, and a 
review of the profit trend, of AIM did not suggest any discounted or ignored trend7.

2005 S$8.5m - 27.0x 
2006 S$6.2m - 37.0x 
2007 S$4.1m - 56.0x 
 
 
 
 
27 Vincent may have had undisclosed information leading him to believe that AIM was 
worth 77% more than its IPO price, but this would be insider trading.  
                                                 
7 In fact the reverse was true.  AIM looked decided expensive at 35 cents with a historic 2005 PER of 27x and 
a prospective 2006 PER of 37x.  
 
116 
 
 
 
28 The pattern of Vincent’s trades suggests to me the valuation of AIM may not have 
been the only or even the primary factor motivating him.  Any investor, even a major 
shareholder, will want to maximize their profit on their investment.  Thus they would 
try to keep their cost of purchases low.  Vincent appeared determined to do the 
opposite.  For instance: 
 
a. He did not spread his trades but concentrated them between the 15 February 
2006 and 31 March 2006 and as shown in the chart below.  Such a concentration 
of buying could and did have dramatic effects.   As noted in Point 9 and in Chart 
1, the Shares started to significantly outperform the STI and the SESMANU 
around February and March 2006 and during Vincent’s initial purchasing spree.  
As a result the average cost that Vincent paid would have been higher than one 
paid by a prudent investor seeking to maximize returns; 
 
Chart 9: Pattern of Vincent’s trading during the Relevant Period 
 
 
 
 
b. Vincent started buying the Shares, after having made no trades between the 3 
April 2006 and the 15 May 2006, on the 16 May 2006.  As noted in Point 10, 
between 15 May 2006 and 14 June 2006, the STI and the SESMANU declined 
by 9% and 14%.  Vincent’s initial purchases at around 31 cents could arguably 
be said to make sense given the decline of AIM Shares from above 34 cents.   
Vincent’s later purchases at around 33 cents and 33.5 cents, given the market 
correction, do not.  It is difficult to understand why Vincent did not spread his 
buying over more days to achieve lower buying costs. 
 
c. An investor seeking to minimize cost: would not bias his trades towards the 
afternoon session but would spread his trades evenly throughout the day.  This 
is because to do so would result in afternoon session and closing price rising 
and thus increasing the cost for the following day’s purchases.  As evidenced in 
 -
 500,000
 1,000,000
 1,500,000
 2,000,000
 2,500,000
 3,000,000
 3,500,000
 4,000,000
Vincent's Buying Pattern
 
117 
 
 
Point 13, Vincent biased his trades towards the afternoon and pre-close trading 
sessions. 
 
d. An investor seeking to minimize cost would not aggressively seek to execute the 
last trade or aggressively trade in the pre-close.  This is because to do so would 
result in the closing price rising and thus increasing the cost for the following 
day’s purchases.  Point 14 clearly shows that by biasing his trades towards the 
afternoon session and aggressively seeking to execute the last trade and trade 
in the pre-close, Vincent significantly increased his pricing risk (the spread was 
larger) and paid more.   
 
29 I believe that I have demonstrated in Points 5 to 20 that Vincent’s actions 
significantly impacted the price of, the traded volume of and thus the market for the 
Shares.   In Points 21 to 28 I considered the likely actions and resulting trading 
pattern of a major shareholder of a relatively recent listed company and that of a 
prudent investor and compared them to Vincent’s actions and trading pattern.  
Having done so, I find it difficult to escape the conclusion that Vincent intended to 
affect the price of AIM Shares.  Vincent knew or should have known that his trading 
pattern would significant impact the price of AIM Shares.  Vincent knew or should 
have known that his actions would cause the price of AIM Shares to rise significantly 
thereby creating a misleading appearance in the price of AIM Shares. 
 
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any clarification or have any questions or 
comments.  Thanking you for your attention. 
 
 
Yours Sincerely
