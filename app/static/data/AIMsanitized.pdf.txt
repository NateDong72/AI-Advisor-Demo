Expert Opinion Report 
 
 
Dear Madam, 
 
Please accept this letter as my considered opinion to the questions posed under your Terms 
of Reference received by myself on [7 May 2008] with respect to S197(1)(b) of the Securities 
and Futures Act (chapter 289, 2002 Revised Edition). 
 
Background 
 
1. Glossary and Facts provided to myself and used in this report: 
 
a. “Company01” or “the Company” means Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Corp Ltd 
an electronics manufacturing services provider, specializing in medium and 
high-end application for aerospace-avionics, medical, life sciences, data 
storage, semi-conductor and fiber optics  industries and which was listed on 
the SGX main board on 26 May 2005 with an initial public offering price of 
$0.20;  
 
b. “Xxx” shall mean Mrs. Xxx xxxx xxxx, the wife of xxSuspect01xx; 
 
c. “Intraday Price” means the change in the price between the day’s opening 
price and the day’s closing price during the Relevant Period.  For example on 
the 27/3/2006 the opening price of the Shares was 33 cents and the closing 
price was 36 cents.  The Intraday price was thus 3 cents.  Note the opening 
 
12 
 
 
price is not necessarily the same as the previous day’s closing price.  The 
closing price of the 26/3/2006 was 32.5 cents.  
 
d. “Market Days” means the days on which the Singapore Stock Exchange was 
open for trading; 
 
e. “Relevant Period” means the 15 February 2006 and 31 October 2006 
inclusive; 
 
f. “SESMANU” means the SES Manufacturing Index; 
 
g. “SFA” means Securities and Futures Act (chapter 289, 2002 Revised Edition); 
 
h. “SGX” shall mean the Singapore Exchanged Limited and its subsidiaries the 
Singapore Stock Exchange and the Singapore International Monetary 
Exchange; 
 
i. “Share(s)” or “Company01 Shares” means the ordinary, issued and fully paid shares 
of Company01 and which are listed on the SGX;  
 
j. “STI” means the Straits Times Index; 
 
k. “xxSuspect01xx” shall mean Dr. xxSuspect01xx xxx xxx xxx or xxSuspect01xx xxx xxx xxx and 
Xxx Xxx xxXx.  Thus when the report speaks of xxSuspect01xx’s action it means 
either the action of xxSuspect01xx xxx xxx xxx solely or the actions of xxSuspect01xx xxx 
xxx xxxx and xxx xxxx xxxx jointly. 
 
l. “74 Days” means the 74 days during the Relevant Period on which xxSuspect01xx 
executed a trade;  
 
m. One folder of information and further supplementary data by way of e-mail 
and as listed in Appendix 1.   
 
 
 
13 
 
 
Terms of Reference 
 
2. For the period between 15 February 2006 and 31 October 2006, 
 
2.1 Having regard to the prevailing market conditions, 
 
a. What appearance did the orders and trades conducted by xxSuspect01xx create, 
or were likely to create, with respect to the market for Company01 shares? In 
particular, did the orders and trades by xxSuspect01xx create, or were likely to 
create, a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for Company01 
shares? 
 
b. What appearance did the orders and trades conducted by xxSuspect01xx create, 
or were likely to create, with respect to the price of Company01 shares? In 
particular, did the orders and trades by xxSuspect01xx create, or were likely to 
create, a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price of Company01 
shares? 
 
2.2 Should you be of the opinion that the orders and trades by xxSuspect01xx had 
affected the market for and/or price of Company01 shares in any way, please give 
your opinion on whether it could be inferred that the orders and trades were 
intentionally carried out to cause such an appearance or effect, and if so, the 
basis of this inference.  
 
In the above analysis, you may assume that the orders and trades in Xxx Xxxx Xxxx’s 
securities trading account were conducted by xxSuspect01xx.

Important Notice 
 
3 All my expert opinions rely on one significant assumption - that the trading efficiency 
of the Singapore Stock Market is best described by the ‘semi-strong form’ market 
efficiency theory.  This market theory states that equity markets are generally 
efficient but are not always or wholly efficient.  There are rival theories and they 
include: a ‘strong form’ theory that postulates that stock markets are wholly efficient; 
and a ‘weak form’ theory that postulates that stock markets are wholly inefficient.  In 
a wholly efficient market (‘strong form’) all information is known and thus no action 
undertaken by any person can distort or manipulate the market.  In a wholly 
inefficient market (‘weak form’) very little information is available to, or known by, 
investors.  Thus all actions distort the market significantly.  It is my experience that 
most of my fellow professionals in the finance industry adhere to the semi-strong 
form market efficiency assumption. 
 
4 This expert opinion has been prepared in the knowledge that it may be used in a 
court of law. Not withstanding the fact that this expert opinion was requested by the 
Commercial Affairs Department, I confirm that this expert opinion is independent in 
the sense that the opinions it sets forth have not been influenced by the Commercial 
Affairs Department and has been prepared to assist the Court rather than to support 
the case before me.  I further confirm that I understand my duties as an expert 
witness to the Court and that I have complied with such duties.

Price for the Securities 
 
5 During the Relevant Period there were xxx Market Days, meaning xxx days when 
the SGX was open for trading.  Company01 Shares only traded on 146 days out of the xxx 
available days, meaning on xx Market Days during the Relevant Period there were 
no trades in Company01 Shares. 
 
6 Of the xxx days that Company01 Shares were traded during the Relevant Period, xxSuspect01xx 
traded on xx of those days.  Meaning that xxSuspect01xx traded on xx.x% or just above 
half the number of days Company01 Shares was traded during the Relevant Period.  xxSuspect01xx 
was therefore a very active trader of Company01 Shares during the Relevant Period.  
 
7 During the Relevant Period some xx,xxx,xxx Shares were traded.  During the 
Relevant Period xxSuspect01xx bought xx,xxx,xxx Shares.  During the Relevant Period 
xxSuspect01xx sold no Shares.  xxSuspect01xx thus accounted for some xx% of all traded volume. 
xxSuspect01xx therefore contributed very significantly to the traded volume of, and was a 
very important source of demand for, the Shares during the Relevant Period. 
 
8 During the rest of xxxx, being the xx Market Days of xxxx not within the Relevant 
Period, xxSuspect01xx bought x,xxx,xxx Shares.  Meaning that xxSuspect01xx bought a total of 
xx,xxx,xxx Shares in xxxx of which nearly xx% were during the Relevant Period.   
 
9 x Market days after the start1 of the Relevant Period (being xx Feb. xxxx) and as 
shown on the following page, the price of the Shares started to significantly 
outperform the overall market2 and the industrial sector3 to which Company01 belongs.  x 
Market days after the end1 of the Relevant Period (being xx Nov. xxxx) the price of 
the Shares started to significantly underperform the STI and SESMANU indices.   
 
                                                 
1 It is not uncommon for an observable trend to emerge only after a period due to price “inertia”.

Chart 1: The relative performance of Company01 Shares vs the market as represented 
by the STI and the industrial sector to which it belongs as represented by the 
SESMANU 
 
 
 
10 During the Relevant Period and more specifically between the xx May xxxx and xx 
June xxxx, the STI and the SESMANU declined by x% and xx%, respectively.  In 
contrast, and during this period, the price of Company01 Shares rose by x% or x cent from 
xx cents to xx cents. 
 
11 I have reviewed the announcements of Company01 for the whole of xxxx.  A list of the 
announcements made by Company01 is shown in Appendix x.  
 
11.1 There were only two notable announcements prior to the xx February xxxx 
and the start of the Company01 Share price rally.  I do not believe that these 
announcements could have contributed to the price of the Shares 
outperforming so significantly the STI and SESMANU during the period 
described in Point x given that:  
 
a. The first announcement on xx January xxxx was with respect to the 
acquisition of the intellectual property rights to the following lancet 
assembly, safety syringe, safety heel stick & safety scalpel.  In an 
announcement dated xx January xxxx Company01 further announced it was 
unable to judge the likely impact of this acquisition as the inventions were 
new.  Further, and given that Company01’s main products are avionics for the 
aerospace industry it is difficult to see why investors would get very excited 
by ASIM acquiring a mass market low per unit value medical device.

b. The second announcement on the xx February xxxx is with respect to the 
full year xxxx earnings.  On an pro-forma adjusted basis the net profit 
announced was S$x.x million down from FYxxxx’s S$xx.x million.  It is 
also difficult to see why investors would greet such a decline warmly.  
 
11.2 There were only two notable announcements in the x weeks leading up to xx 
November xxxx and the start of the Company01 Share price decline.  I do not believe 
that these announcements which both occurred on the xx November xxxx 
could have contributed to the price of the Shares underperforming so 
significantly the STI and SESMANU post this date given that: 
 
c. One announcement, in my opinion, was mildly negative and relates to the 
resignation of the COO of Company01.  Unlike many small to medium sized 
companies Company01 is relatively rich in management.  It has xxSuspect01xx who is the 
founder, major shareholder, Executive Chairman and CEO and who has 
a host of degrees and many years experience in the industry.  It has Dr. 
Philip Poh as Group Managing Director and who also has a host of 
degrees and is a specialist in supply chain management.  
  
d. One announcement, in my opinion, was mildly positive and relates to 3rd 
quarter xxxx earnings.  The number showed that 3rd quarter xxxx net 
profit after tax as compared to that of the 3rd quarter xxxx rose by xx.x%.  
However, the cumulative net profit after tax of the first x months of xxxx 
was still lower than that of the first x months of xxxx though the gap had 
declined significantly from the first quarters -xx.x% to -x.x%.  
 
12 I have reviewed the announcements of Company01 during for xxxx and do not believe that 
these announcements could have contributed to the price of the Shares performing 
so well during the market correction as described in Point xx.  In fact the only 
announcement of note was a negative announcement of the 11 May xxxx and which 
preceded the market correction.  This was the announcement of the 1st quarter 
earnings.  This announcement showed revenues down x.x%, a sharp gross margin 
decline and net profit after tax down -xx.x%. 
 
13 xxSuspect01xx’s pattern of trading during the Relevant Period was unusual.  Of the xx Days 
that xxSuspect01xx traded: 
 
e. On most of these days, xxSuspect01xx executed the bulk of his day’s trade in the 
afternoon4.  On xx days, accounting for xx% of the xx Days, xxSuspect01xx executed 
xx% or more of his trades in the afternoon.  On xx days, accounting for xx% of 
the xx Days, xxSuspect01xx executed the xx% or more of his trades in the afternoon.   
On xx days, accounting for 40% of the xx Days, xxSuspect01xx executed all of his 
                                                 
4 With respect to the volume of Shares xxSuspect01xx executed, the bulk also took place in the afternoon (about 
xx%). 
 
18 
 
 
trades in the afternoon.  Given the size and incidence of xxSuspect01xx’s trades, it is 
difficult to envisage a situation whereby xxSuspect01xx’s bias towards afternoon 
trading would not influence the afternoon session price of the Shares, and the 
closing price of the Shares, during the Relevant Period;   
 
Table 2: The pattern of xxSuspect01xx’s trades on the days that he traded during 
the Relevant Period 
 
 
 
f. On xx days, or xx% of the xx Days, xxSuspect01xx was either the last trade of the day 
or xxSuspect01xx accounted for the whole or a very significant percentage of the pre-
close5.  Of the xx days, xx days did not have pre-close activity. On these days, 
xxSuspect01xx’s trade was the last trade of the day.  Of the xx days, xx days had pre-
close activity. On these days, xxSuspect01xx’s trades accounted for the whole or a very 
significant percentage of the pre-close trade on these days.  Given the size and 
incidence of xxSuspect01xx’s trades it is difficult to envisage a situation whereby 
xxSuspect01xx’s preference for being the last trade of the day or dominating pre-close 
trade would not have influenced the closing price on all of these xx days during 
the Relevant Period;

*  There was no afternoon or pre-close trade.  xxSuspect01xx’s trade was the last trade of the

14 The days on which xxSuspect01xx traded displayed unusual price movements.  The table 
below tracks the Intraday Price, meaning the change in the price between the day’s 
opening price and the day’s closing price during the Relevant Period.  For example, 
the number 23 in the table on the following page means that on xx days the Intraday 
Price, on the days that xxSuspect01xx did not trade, experienced no change.   For example, 
the number 19 in the table on the following page means that on xx days the Intraday 
Price, on the days that xxSuspect01xx did trade, experienced a +x cent change.   From this 
table it can be noted that:  
 
a. On the days that xxSuspect01xx did not trade, the Intraday Price spread was -x cent to 
+3 cents.  The spread was thus x cents or about xx.x% of the average closing 
price of the Share6 price during the Relevant Period.  But on the days that 
                                                 
6 Of about xx.x cents 
 
xxx 
 
 
xxSuspect01xx traded, the Intraday Price spread was -x cents to +x cents.  The spread 
was thus x cents or a whopping 22% of the average closing price of the Share6 
price during the Relevant Period.   
 
b. The average Intraday Price movement, on the days that xxSuspect01xx did not trade 
was 0.43 cents.   The average Intraday Price movement, on the days that 
xxSuspect01xx traded was x.xx cents or nearly x.x times larger.    
  
c. Last but not least, the usual steady state, meaning the median Intraday Price 
change (represented by the xx% backgrounded in yellow in the table below) on 
days that xxSuspect01xx did not traded was zero (no change).  The most likely 
movement on days that xxSuspect01xx did not traded (xx% being xx% and xx% and 
xx%) was + or – x cent.  On the other hand, on days that xxSuspect01xx traded, the 
median Intraday Price change (represented by the xx% backgrounded in yellow 
in the table below) was 1 cent and the most likely movement (xx% being xx% 
and xx% and xx%) was + or – x cents.

15 Given Points x to xx, I am of the opinion that; 
 
a. xxSuspect01xx was a very significant trader and source of demand for Company01 shares 
during the Relevant Period and significant trader and source of demand for Company01 
shares in 2006 as a whole. 
 
b. From the perspective of an ordinary investor, and given the information 
available from Company01 in 2006, there was no apparent reason for: (i) the price of 
Company01 Shares to significantly outperformed the STI and SESMANU during most 
of the Relevant Period and particularly during 27 Feb. 2006 to 10 Nov. 2006; 
(ii) the price of the Shares to rise when the STI and SESMANU indices fell 
during the market correction of 15 May to 14 June 2006. 
 
c. xxSuspect01xx’s pattern of trading was unusual.  xxSuspect01xx favoured trading in the 
afternoon session and was frequently the last trade of the day on days when 
there were no pre-close trades.  xxSuspect01xx trades frequently dominate pre-close 
trades on days when there were pre-close trades.  It would be difficult to 
envisage a situation where xxSuspect01xx’s trading pattern would not impact the 
appearance with respect to the price of Company01 Shares. 
 
d. On the days that xxSuspect01xx traded, xxSuspect01xx’s trades altered the Intraday Price’s 
total, average and median spreads.  Therefore, and on the days during the 
Relevant Period that xxSuspect01xx traded, xxSuspect01xx’s trades created a false or 
misleading appearance with respect to the price of Company01 Shares. 
 
e. When one investor is such as significant trader of a security, it is inevitable that 
this investor will impact not only the price on the day that he trades but also 
other investor perceptions and thus the price on days which he did not trade.  
Therefore, and on the days during the Relevant Period that xxSuspect01xx did not 
trade, xxSuspect01xx’s trades was likely to create a false or misleading appearance 
with respect to the price of Company01 Shares. 
 
 
112 
 
 
f. xxSuspect01xx trades during the Relevant Period created, and were likely to create, a 
false or misleading appearance with respect to the price of Company01 shares.  
 
 
 
 
Market for the Securities 
 
16 A market can be defined in several ways.  For the purposes of this report I have 
defined a market as a process where securities are bought and sold by various 
parties or persons.  Thus, and at its most basic, a market is simply the sum of the 
price at which quantities of a security has been traded. 
 
Market = sum (price * volume traded) 
 
17 Given Point 16 the following matrix can be derived.  The word impact means the 
impact of xxSuspect01xx’s action on the price or the traded volume of the Share. 
 
 Impact on Price of 
Share is significant 
Impact on Price of 
Share is material

(quadrant 9) 
 
Yes: (quadrants 1, 2 and 3) means orders and trades by xxSuspect01xx created, or were likely to create, 
a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for Company01 Shares. 
 
Maybe: (quadrants 3, 5 and 7) means orders and trades by xxSuspect01xx may have created a false or 
misleading appearance with respect to the market for Company01 Shares. 
 
No: (quadrants 6, 8 and 9) means orders and trades by xxSuspect01xx did not created, or were unlikely 
to create, a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for Company01 Shares. 
 
18 In Point 7 it was noted that xxSuspect01xx accounted for some 46% of all traded volume 
during the Relevant Period.  Once any investor accounts for more than 30% of a 
day or a period’s trade, it is inevitable that the investor will impact the traded volume 
of the security for that day or period (the “30% Rule”).   
 
19 Besides being significant during that Relevant Period, xxSuspect01xx’s trades were also 
very significant on select days during the Relevant Period (please see table on 
 
113 
 
 
following page). On 8 of those days xxSuspect01xx accounted for all the purchases. On 63 
days (being 8 + 55 days) xxSuspect01xx accounted for 50% or more of the purchases.  On 
69 days (being 8 + 55 + 6 days) xxSuspect01xx accounted for 30% or more of the 
purchases.  69 days represent 47% or nearly half of the days that Company01 Shares were 
traded during the Relevant Period.

20 In Points 9, 10, 13 and 14, I demonstrated that xxSuspect01xx’s trades significantly affected 
the price of Company01 Shares.  Given this and Points 16 to 19, I am of the opinion that: 
  
a. On the 69 days that xxSuspect01xx accounted for 30% or more of that day’s total 
trades, xxSuspect01xx would have very significantly impacted the traded volume of 
those days.  Accordingly xxSuspect01xx’s actions fall into quadrant 1 of Point 17’s 
matrix.  Accordingly I am of the belief that orders and trades by xxSuspect01xx created 
a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for Company01 Shares on 
these 69 days. 
 
b. xxSuspect01xx accounted for 46% of all trades during the Relevant Period and thus 
was a significant trader of Company01 Shares during the Relevant Period.  Accordingly 
xxSuspect01xx’s actions fall into quadrant 1 of Point 17’s matrix.  When one investor is 
such as significant trader of a security it is inevitable that this investor will impact 
not only the traded volume of that day but also other investor perceptions and 
thus the traded volume of days on which he did not trade.   Accordingly I am of 
the belief that the orders and trades by xxSuspect01xx were likely to create a false or 
misleading appearance with respect to the market for Company01 Shares during the 
whole of the Relevant Period.

Intentions of xxSuspect01xx 
 
21 I have neither spoken to xxSuspect01xx or Teo nor read any statement made by them.  
Thus my observations below are merely ones based on the data and facts detailed 
in Appendix 1 of this report.    
 
22 xxSuspect01xx is the major shareholder of Company01.  xxSuspect01xx as at the 3 Jan. 2006, or on the 
first Market Day of 2006, owned 480,671,528 Shares or about 73.3% of the total 
outstanding share capital of Company01. 
 
23 Company01 was listed on the 26 May 2005 or just under 9 months prior to the start of 
xxSuspect01xx’s first purchase on the 16 Feb. 2006 and the Relevant Period. 
 
24 During the Relevant Period, the cumulative holding of xxSuspect01xx rose as follows: 
 
Chart 6: Cumulative Holdings of xxSuspect01xx during the Relative Period 
 
  
 
 
25 The sharp rise in xxSuspect01xx’s holding was unusual given that:  
 
a. When xxSuspect01xx started buying the Shares, Company01 had not been listed a year.  Less 
than 9 months previously Company01 debuted at an IPO price of 20 cents.  But yet by 31 
Mar. 2006 xxSuspect01xx felt it was reasonable pay an average price of 35.5 cents or 
77% more than the IPO price for 1,205,000 Shares (highest average paid price).    
 
b. The announcements that I had reviewed did not suggest that the market had 
incorrectly discounted or was ignoring any significant news.  A review of the 2007 
Annual Report (post balance sheet test) reaffirms my opinion that the market had 
not missed any major trends with respect to Company01 or its industry.

xxSuspect01xx's holding in Company01
 
115 
 
 
Year Net Profit after Tax 
2003 S$6.2m

2006 S$6.2m 
2007 S$4.1m 
 
 
c. The market and investors generally view negatively those securities whose 
liquidity is low.  xxSuspect01xx’s actions reduced the number of shares that he did not 
own from around 175.1 million Shares at the start of the Relevant Period to 140.1 
million Shares at the end of the Relevant Period.  This is a 5.4 percentage point, 
or nearly 20% reduction (!!), in the free float.  
 
d. The market and investors generally view negatively those securities whose major 
shareholder or senior managers are selling the security.  As xxSuspect01xx is both a 
major shareholder and the most senior manager, any selling he may undertake 
could undermine Company01’s Share price.  Meaning xxSuspect01xx could not have been buying 
the shares for trading purposes. 
 
26 One common reason why a major shareholder would acquire significantly more 
shares in his own company is if he believed that the company was significantly 
undervalued by the market.  xxSuspect01xx must have thought that his company was 
reasonably valued, or at least not significantly undervalued, at 20 cents or he would 
not have agreed to IPO at that price.  There were no disclosed information that 
would suggest that the company was being significantly undervalued at the start of 
2006 and that 35.5 cents, the highest average price that xxSuspect01xx paid, was the ‘right’ 
price.  A post event analysis, namely of a review of the 2007 Annual Report, and a 
review of the profit trend, of Company01 did not suggest any discounted or ignored trend7.

2005 S$8.5m - 27.0x 
2006 S$6.2m - 37.0x 
2007 S$4.1m - 56.0x 
 
 
 
 
27 xxSuspect01xx may have had undisclosed information leading him to believe that Company01 was 
worth 77% more than its IPO price, but this would be insider trading.  
                                                 
7 In fact the reverse was true.  Company01 looked decided expensive at 35 cents with a historic 2005 PER of 27x and 
a prospective 2006 PER of 37x.  
 
116 
 
 
 
28 The pattern of xxSuspect01xx’s trades suggests to me the valuation of Company01 may not have 
been the only or even the primary factor motivating him.  Any investor, even a major 
shareholder, will want to maximize their profit on their investment.  Thus they would 
try to keep their cost of purchases low.  xxSuspect01xx appeared determined to do the 
opposite.  For instance: 
 
a. He did not spread his trades but concentrated them between the 15 February 
2006 and 31 March 2006 and as shown in the chart below.  Such a concentration 
of buying could and did have dramatic effects.   As noted in Point 9 and in Chart 
1, the Shares started to significantly outperform the STI and the SESMANU 
around February and March 2006 and during xxSuspect01xx’s initial purchasing spree.  
As a result the average cost that xxSuspect01xx paid would have been higher than one 
paid by a prudent investor seeking to maximize returns; 
 
Chart 9: Pattern of xxSuspect01xx’s trading during the Relevant Period 
 
 
 
 
b. xxSuspect01xx started buying the Shares, after having made no trades between the 3 
April 2006 and the 15 May 2006, on the 16 May 2006.  As noted in Point 10, 
between 15 May 2006 and 14 June 2006, the STI and the SESMANU declined 
by 9% and 14%.  xxSuspect01xx’s initial purchases at around 31 cents could arguably 
be said to make sense given the decline of Company01 Shares from above 34 cents.   
xxSuspect01xx’s later purchases at around 33 cents and 33.5 cents, given the market 
correction, do not.  It is difficult to understand why xxSuspect01xx did not spread his 
buying over more days to achieve lower buying costs. 
 
c. An investor seeking to minimize cost: would not bias his trades towards the 
afternoon session but would spread his trades evenly throughout the day.  This 
is because to do so would result in afternoon session and closing price rising 
and thus increasing the cost for the following day’s purchases.  As evidenced in 
 -
 500,000
 1,000,000
 1,500,000
 2,000,000
 2,500,000
 3,000,000
 3,500,000
 4,000,000
xxSuspect01xx's Buying Pattern
 
117 
 
 
Point 13, xxSuspect01xx biased his trades towards the afternoon and pre-close trading 
sessions. 
 
d. An investor seeking to minimize cost would not aggressively seek to execute the 
last trade or aggressively trade in the pre-close.  This is because to do so would 
result in the closing price rising and thus increasing the cost for the following 
day’s purchases.  Point 14 clearly shows that by biasing his trades towards the 
afternoon session and aggressively seeking to execute the last trade and trade 
in the pre-close, xxSuspect01xx significantly increased his pricing risk (the spread was 
larger) and paid more.   
 
29 I believe that I have demonstrated in Points 5 to 20 that xxSuspect01xx’s actions 
significantly impacted the price of, the traded volume of and thus the market for the 
Shares.   In Points 21 to 28 I considered the likely actions and resulting trading 
pattern of a major shareholder of a relatively recent listed company and that of a 
prudent investor and compared them to xxSuspect01xx’s actions and trading pattern.  
Having done so, I find it difficult to escape the conclusion that xxSuspect01xx intended to 
affect the price of Company01 Shares.  xxSuspect01xx knew or should have known that his trading 
pattern would significant impact the price of Company01 Shares.  xxSuspect01xx knew or should 
have known that his actions would cause the price of Company01 Shares to rise significantly 
thereby creating a misleading appearance in the price of Company01 Shares. 
 
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any clarification or have any questions or 
comments.  Thanking you for your attention. 
 
 
Yours Sincerely
