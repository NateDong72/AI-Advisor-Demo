report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Dear Madam, Please accept this letter as my considered opinion to the questions posed under your Terms of Reference received by myself on [7 May 2008] with respect to S197(1)(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (chapter 289, 2002 Revised Edition)."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Glossary and Facts provided to myself and used in this report:
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"AIM? or ?the Company? means Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Corp Ltd an electronics manufacturing services provider, specializing in medium and high-end application for aerospace-avionics, medical, life sciences, data storage, semi-conductor and fiber optics industries and which was listed on the SGX main board on 26 May 2005 with an initial public offering price of $0.20; b. ?"
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Teo? shall mean Mrs. Teo Siew Ling, the wife of Vincent; c."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Intraday Price? means the change in the price between the day?s opening price and the day?s closing price during the Relevant Period.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,For example on the 27/3/2006 the opening price of the Shares was 33 cents and the closing price was 36 cents.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The Intraday price was thus 3 cents.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Note the opening 12 price is not necessarily the same as the previous day?s closing price.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The closing price of the 26/3/2006 was 32.5 cents.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,d. ?Market Days? means the days on which the Singapore Stock Exchange was open for trading;
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Relevant Period? means the 15 February 2006 and 31 October 2006 inclusive; f. ?
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"SESMANU? means the SES Manufacturing Index; g. ?SFA? means Securities and Futures Act (chapter 289, 2002 Revised Edition);"
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,SGX? shall mean the Singapore Exchanged Limited and its subsidiaries the Singapore Stock Exchange and the Singapore International Monetary Exchange; i. ?Share(s)? or ?
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"AIM Shares? means the ordinary, issued and fully paid shares of AIM and which are listed on the SGX;"
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,j. ?STI? means the Straits Times Index;
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Vincent? shall mean Dr. Vincent Tan Kim Yong or Vincent Tan Kim Yong and Teo Siew Ling.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Thus when the report speaks of Vincent?s action it means either the action of Vincent Tan Kim Yong solely or the actions of Vincent Tan Kim Yong and Teo Siew Ling jointly.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,74 Days? means the 74 days during the Relevant Period on which Vincent executed a trade; m. One
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,folder of information and further supplementary data by way of e-mail and as listed in Appendix 1.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Having regard to the prevailing market conditions, a."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"What appearance did the orders and trades conducted by Vincent create, or were likely to create, with respect to the market for AIM shares?"
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In particular, did the orders and trades by Vincent create, or were likely to create, a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for AIM shares?"
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"What appearance did the orders and trades conducted by Vincent create, or were likely to create, with respect to the price of AIM shares?"
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In particular, did the orders and trades by Vincent create, or were likely to create, a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price of AIM shares?"
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Should you be of the opinion that the orders and trades by Vincent had affected the market for and/or price of AIM shares in any way, please give your opinion on whether it could be inferred that the orders and trades were intentionally carried out to cause such an appearance or effect, and if so, the basis of this inference."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In the above analysis, you may assume that the orders and trades in Teo Siew Ling?s securities trading account were conducted by Vincent."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,All my expert opinions rely on one significant assumption - that the trading efficiency of the Singapore Stock Market is best described by the ?semi-strong form? market efficiency theory.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This market theory states that equity markets are generally efficient but are not always or wholly efficient.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There are rival theories and they include: a ?strong form? theory that postulates that stock markets are wholly efficient; and a ?weak form? theory that postulates that stock markets are wholly inefficient.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,In a wholly efficient market (?strong form?) all information is known and thus no action undertaken by any person can distort or manipulate the market.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In a wholly inefficient market (?weak form?) very little information is available to, or known by, investors."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Thus all actions distort the market significantly.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,It is my experience that most of my fellow professionals in the finance industry adhere to the semi-strong form market efficiency assumption.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This expert opinion has been prepared in the knowledge that it may be used in a court of law.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Not withstanding the fact that this expert opinion was requested by the Commercial Affairs Department, I confirm that this expert opinion is independent in the sense that the opinions it sets forth have not been influenced by the Commercial Affairs Department and has been prepared to assist the Court rather than to support the case before me."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,I further confirm that I understand my duties as an expert witness to the Court and that I have complied with such duties.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"During the Relevant Period there were 185 Market Days, meaning 185 days when the SGX was open for trading."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"AIM Shares only traded on 146 days out of the 185 available days, meaning on 39 Market Days during the Relevant Period there were no trades in AIM Shares."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"Of the 146 days that AIM Shares were traded during the Relevant Period, Vincent traded on 74 of those days."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,Meaning that Vincent traded on 50.6% or just above half the number of days AIM Shares was traded during the Relevant Period.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Vincent was therefore a very active trader of AIM Shares during the Relevant Period.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"During the Relevant Period some 79,997,000 Shares were traded."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"During the Relevant Period Vincent bought 36,878,000 Shares."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,During the Relevant Period Vincent sold no Shares.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,Vincent thus accounted for some 46% of all traded volume.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Vincent therefore contributed very significantly to the traded volume of, and was a very important source of demand for, the Shares during the Relevant Period."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"During the rest of 2006, being the 75 Market Days of 2006 not within the Relevant Period, Vincent bought 8,245,000 Shares."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"Meaning that Vincent bought a total of 45,123,000 Shares in 2006 of which nearly 82% were during the Relevant Period."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"8 Market days after the start1 of the Relevant Period (being 27 Feb. 2006) and as shown on the following page, the price of the Shares started to significantly outperform the overall market2 and the industrial sector3 to which AIM belongs."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,7 Market days after the end1 of the Relevant Period (being 10 Nov. 2006) the price of the Shares started to significantly underperform the STI and SESMANU indices.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,It is not uncommon for an observable trend to emerge only after a period due to price ?inertia?.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In contrast, and during this period, the price of AIM Shares rose by 3% or 1 cent from 33 cents to 34 cents."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,I have reviewed the announcements of AIM for the whole of 2006.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,A list of the announcements made by AIM is shown in Appendix 3.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There were only two notable announcements prior to the 27 February 2006 and the start of the AIM Share price rally.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,I do not believe that these announcements could have contributed to the price of the Shares outperforming so significantly the STI and SESMANU during the period described in Point 9 given that: a.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The first announcement on 19 January 2006 was with respect to the acquisition of the intellectual property rights to the following lancet assembly, safety syringe, safety heel stick & safety scalpel."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,In an announcement dated 20 January 2006 AIM further announced it was unable to judge the likely impact of this acquisition as the inventions were new.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Further, and given that AIM?s main products are avionics for the aerospace industry it is difficult to see why investors would get very excited by ASIM acquiring a mass market low per unit value medical device."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The second announcement on the 15 February 2006 is with respect to the full year 2005 earnings.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,On an pro-forma adjusted basis the net profit announced was S$8.5 million down from FY2004?s S$12.1 million.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,It is also difficult to see why investors would greet such a decline warmly.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There were only two notable announcements in the 8 weeks leading up to 10 November 2006 and the start of the AIM Share price decline.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,I do not believe that these announcements which both occurred on the 10 November 2006 could have contributed to the price of the Shares underperforming so significantly the STI and SESMANU post this date given that:
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"One announcement, in my opinion, was mildly negative and relates to the resignation of the COO of AIM."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Unlike many small to medium sized companies AIM is relatively rich in management.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"It has Vincent who is the founder, major shareholder, Executive Chairman and CEO and who has a host of degrees and many years experience in the industry."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,It has Dr. Philip Poh as Group Managing Director and who also has a host of degrees and is a specialist in supply chain management.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"d. One announcement, in my opinion, was mildly positive and relates to 3rd quarter 2006 earnings."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The number showed that 3rd quarter 2006 net profit after tax as compared to that of the 3rd quarter 2005 rose by 33.1%.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"However, the cumulative net profit after tax of the first 9 months of 2006 was still lower than that of the first 9 months of 2005 though the gap had declined significantly from the first quarters -39.0% to -7.8%."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,I have reviewed the announcements of AIM during for 2006 and do not believe that these announcements could have contributed to the price of the Shares performing so well during the market correction as described in Point 10.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,In fact the only announcement of note was a negative announcement of the 11 May 2006 and which preceded the market correction.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This was the announcement of the 1st quarter earnings.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This announcement showed revenues down 6.6%, a sharp gross margin decline and net profit after tax down -39.0%."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,13 Vincent?s pattern of trading during the Relevant Period was unusual.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Of the 74 Days that Vincent traded: e.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"On most of these days, Vincent executed the bulk of his day?s trade in the afternoon4."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"On 64 days, accounting for 87% of the 74 Days, Vincent executed 50% or more of his trades in the afternoon."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"On 53 days, accounting for 71% of the 74 Days, Vincent executed the 65% or more of his trades in the afternoon."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"On 30 days, accounting for 40% of the 74 Days, Vincent executed all of his 4 With respect to the volume of Shares Vincent executed, the bulk also took place in the afternoon (about 60%)."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Given the size and incidence of Vincent?s trades, it is difficult to envisage a situation whereby Vincent?s bias towards afternoon trading would not influence the afternoon session price of the Shares, and the closing price of the Shares, during the Relevant Period; Table 2:"
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The pattern of Vincent?s trades on the days that he traded during the Relevant Period f.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,"On 61 days, or 82% of the 74 Days, Vincent was either the last trade of the day or Vincent accounted for the whole or a very significant percentage of the pre- close5."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Of the 61 days, 39 days did not have pre-close activity."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"On these days, Vincent?s trade was the last trade of the day."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Of the 61 days, 22 days had pre- close activity."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"On these days, Vincent?s trades accounted for the whole or a very significant percentage of the pre-close trade on these days."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Given the size and incidence of Vincent?s trades it is difficult to envisage a situation whereby Vincent?s preference for being the last trade of the day or dominating pre-close trade would not have influenced the closing price on all of these 61 days during the Relevant Period;
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,For more details please see Appendix 4.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There was no afternoon or pre-close trade.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,,Vincent?s trade was the last trade of the morning session.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The table below tracks the Intraday Price, meaning the change in the price between the day?s opening price and the day?s closing price during the Relevant Period."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For example, the number 23 in the table on the following page means that on 23 days the Intraday Price, on the days that Vincent did not trade, experienced no change."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For example, the number 19 in the table on the following page means that on 19 days the Intraday Price, on the days that Vincent did trade, experienced a +1 cent change."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,From this table it can be noted that: a.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"On the days that Vincent did not trade, the Intraday Price spread was -1 cent to +3 cents."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The spread was thus 4 cents or about 12.5% of the average closing price of the Share6 price during the Relevant Period.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"But on the days that 6 Of about 31.9 cents 110 Vincent traded, the Intraday Price spread was -2 cents to +5 cents."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The spread was thus 7 cents or a whopping 22% of the average closing price of the Share6 price during the Relevant Period.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"The average Intraday Price movement, on the days that Vincent did not trade was 0.43 cents."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"The average Intraday Price movement, on the days that Vincent traded was 1.05 cents or nearly 2.5 times larger."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"Last but not least, the usual steady state, meaning the median Intraday Price change (represented by the 32% backgrounded in yellow in the table below) on days that Vincent did not traded was zero (no change)."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,The most likely movement on days that Vincent did not traded (80% being 29% and 32% and 19%) was + or ? 1 cent.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"On the other hand, on days that Vincent traded, the median Intraday Price change (represented by the 45% backgrounded in yellow in the table below) was 1 cent and the most likely movement (82% being 26% and 45% and 11%) was + or ? 2 cents."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Given Points 5 to 14, I am of the opinion that; a. Vincent was a very significant trader and source of demand for AIM shares during the Relevant Period and significant trader and source of demand for AIM shares in 2006 as a whole."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"From the perspective of an ordinary investor, and given the information available from AIM in 2006, there was no apparent reason for: (i) the price of AIM Shares to significantly outperformed the STI and SESMANU during"
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,the price of the Shares to rise when the STI and SESMANU indices fell during the market correction of 15 May to 14 June 2006.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,c. Vincent?s pattern of trading was unusual.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,Vincent favoured trading in the afternoon session and was frequently the last trade of the day on days when there were no pre-close trades.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,Vincent trades frequently dominate pre-close trades on days when there were pre-close trades.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,It would be difficult to envisage a situation where Vincent?s trading pattern would not impact the appearance with respect to the price of AIM Shares.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"On the days that Vincent traded, Vincent?s trades altered the Intraday Price?s total, average and median spreads."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Therefore, and on the days during the Relevant Period that Vincent traded, Vincent?s trades created a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price of AIM Shares."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"When one investor is such as significant trader of a security, it is inevitable that this investor will impact not only the price on the day that he trades but also other investor perceptions and thus the price on days which he did not trade."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Therefore, and on the days during the Relevant Period that Vincent did not trade, Vincent?s trades was likely to create a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price of AIM Shares."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"112 f. Vincent trades during the Relevant Period created, and were likely to create, a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price of AIM shares."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Market for the Securities 16 A market can be defined in several ways.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,For the purposes of this report I have defined a market as a process where securities are bought and sold by various parties or persons.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Thus, and at its most basic, a market is simply the sum of the price at which quantities of a security has been traded."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Market = sum (price * volume traded)
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,17 Given Point 16 the following matrix can be derived.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The word impact means the impact of Vincent?s action on the price or the traded volume of the Share.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Maybe (quadrant 3) Impact on traded volume of Share is material
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,In Point 7 it was noted that Vincent accounted for some 46% of all traded volume during the Relevant Period.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Once any investor accounts for more than 30% of a day or a period?s trade, it is inevitable that the investor will impact the traded volume of the security for that day or period (the ?30% Rule?)."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"Besides being significant during that Relevant Period, Vincent?s trades were also very significant on select days during the Relevant Period (please see table on 113 following page)."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,On 8 of those days Vincent accounted for all the purchases.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,On 63 days (being 8 + 55 days) Vincent accounted for 50% or more of the purchases.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,Vincent accounted for 30% or more of the purchases.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,69 days represent 47% or nearly half of the days that AIM Shares were traded during the Relevant Period.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Total Traded Volume Accounted for 100%
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In Points 9, 10, 13 and 14, I demonstrated that Vincent?s trades significantly affected the price of AIM Shares."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Given this and Points 16 to 19, I am of the opinion that: a. On the 69 days that Vincent accounted for 30% or more of that day?s total trades, Vincent would have very significantly impacted the traded volume of those days."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Accordingly Vincent?s actions fall into quadrant 1 of Point 17?s matrix.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Accordingly I am of the belief that orders and trades by Vincent created a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for AIM Shares on these 69 days.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,b. Vincent accounted for 46% of all trades during the Relevant Period and thus was a significant trader of AIM Shares during the Relevant Period.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Accordingly Vincent?s actions fall into quadrant 1 of Point 17?s matrix.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,When one investor is such as significant trader of a security it is inevitable that this investor will impact not only the traded volume of that day but also other investor perceptions and thus the traded volume of days on which he did not trade.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Accordingly I am of the belief that the orders and trades by Vincent were likely to create a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for AIM Shares during the whole of the Relevant Period.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,I have neither spoken to Vincent or Teo nor read any statement made by them.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Thus my observations below are merely ones based on the data and facts detailed in Appendix 1 of this report.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,22 Vincent is the major shareholder of AIM.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"Vincent as at the 3 Jan. 2006, or on the first Market Day of 2006, owned 480,671,528 Shares or about 73.3% of the total outstanding share capital of AIM."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,23 AIM was listed on the 26 May 2005 or just under 9 months prior to the start of Vincent?s first purchase on the 16 Feb. 2006 and the Relevant Period.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"During the Relevant Period, the cumulative holding of Vincent rose as follows:"
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Less than 9 months previously AIM debuted at an IPO price of 20 cents.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"Vincent felt it was reasonable pay an average price of 35.5 cents or 77% more than the IPO price for 1,205,000 Shares (highest average paid price)."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,The announcements that I had reviewed did not suggest that the market had incorrectly discounted or was ignoring any significant news.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,A review of the 2007 Annual Report (post balance sheet test) reaffirms my opinion that the market had not missed any major trends with respect to AIM or its industry.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,6 Vincent's holding in AIM 115 Year Net Profit after Tax 2003
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The market and investors generally view negatively those securities whose liquidity is low.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,Vincent?s actions reduced the number of shares that he did not own from around 175.1 million Shares at the start of the Relevant Period to 140.1 million Shares at the end of the Relevant Period.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This is a 5.4 percentage point, or nearly 20% reduction (!!), in the free float."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The market and investors generally view negatively those securities whose major shareholder or senior managers are selling the security.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"As Vincent is both a major shareholder and the most senior manager, any selling he may undertake could undermine AIM?s Share price."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Meaning Vincent could not have been buying the shares for trading purposes.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,One common reason why a major shareholder would acquire significantly more shares in his own company is if he believed that the company was significantly undervalued by the market.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Vincent must have thought that his company was reasonably valued, or at least not significantly undervalued, at 20 cents or he would not have agreed to IPO at that price."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"There were no disclosed information that would suggest that the company was being significantly undervalued at the start of 2006 and that 35.5 cents, the highest average price that Vincent paid, was the ?right? price."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"A post event analysis, namely of a review of the 2007 Annual Report, and a review of the profit trend, of AIM did not suggest any discounted or ignored trend7."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Vincent may have had undisclosed information leading him to believe that AIM was worth 77% more than its IPO price, but this would be insider trading."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,7 In fact the reverse was true.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,AIM looked decided expensive at 35 cents with a historic 2005 PER of 27x and a prospective 2006 PER of 37x.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The pattern of Vincent?s trades suggests to me the valuation of AIM may not have been the only or even the primary factor motivating him.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Any investor, even a major shareholder, will want to maximize their profit on their investment."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Thus they would try to keep their cost of purchases low.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,,For instance: a. He did not spread his trades but concentrated them between the 15 February 2006 and 31 March 2006 and as shown in the chart below.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Such a concentration of buying could and did have dramatic effects.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"As noted in Point 9 and in Chart 1, the Shares started to significantly outperform the STI and the SESMANU around February and March 2006 and during Vincent?s initial purchasing spree."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,As a result the average cost that Vincent paid would have been higher than one paid by a prudent investor seeking to maximize returns
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"b. Vincent started buying the Shares, after having made no trades between the 3 April 2006 and the 15 May 2006, on the 16 May 2006."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"May 2006 and 14 June 2006, the STI and the SESMANU declined by 9% and 14%."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,,Vincent?s initial purchases at around 31 cents could arguably be said to make sense given the decline of AIM Shares from above 34 cents.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"Vincent?s later purchases at around 33 cents and 33.5 cents, given the market correction, do not."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,It is difficult to understand why Vincent did not spread his buying over more days to achieve lower buying costs.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,An investor seeking to minimize cost: would not bias his trades towards the afternoon session but would spread his trades evenly throughout the day.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,This is because to do so would result in afternoon session and closing price rising and thus increasing the cost for the following day?s purchases.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As evidenced in Vincent's Buying Pattern, Vincent biased his trades towards the afternoon and pre-close trading sessions."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,An investor seeking to minimize cost would not aggressively seek to execute the last trade or aggressively trade in the pre-close.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,This is because to do so would result in the closing price rising and thus increasing the cost for the following day?s purchases.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Point 14 clearly shows that by biasing his trades towards the afternoon session and aggressively seeking to execute the last trade and trade in the pre-close, Vincent significantly increased his pricing risk (the spread was larger) and paid more."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"I believe that I have demonstrated in Points 5 to 20 that Vincent?s actions significantly impacted the price of, the traded volume of and thus the market for the Shares."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,In Points 21 to 28 I considered the likely actions and resulting trading pattern of a major shareholder of a relatively recent listed company and that of a prudent investor and compared them to Vincent?s actions and trading pattern.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Having done so, I find it difficult to escape the conclusion that Vincent intended to affect the price of AIM Shares."
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Vincent knew or should have known that his trading pattern would significant impact the price of AIM Shares.
report01.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Vincent knew or should have known that his actions would cause the price of AIM Shares to rise significantly thereby creating a misleading appearance in the price of AIM Shares.

report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The Leong Group traded on 15 days at the Pre?Close during the Relevant Period.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Close but overall was not very active at the Pre?Close during the Relevant Period.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Close days during the Relevant Period was not very significant.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The Leong Group traded some 2,393,000 (being 2,341,000 bought and 52,000 sold)"
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Close during the Relevant Period was 74.9 million shares.

report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,The Leong Group thus traded about 2.1% of all the Shares then in existence.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This is not that significant a percentage for a single group even given that Autron is a medium sized company with limited free float.

report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Leong Group knew that the Ng Group was trading.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Therefore the Leong Group knew or should have known that its actions would have a greater impact.

report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,If this were excluded (to allow us to examine the true impact of the Leong Group?s actions) the Leong Group accounted for more than half of non?Ng Group trades on 11 days.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The Leong Group accounted for all non?Ng Group trades on 8 days.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"To my mind ""a false or misleading appearance"" implies that in some way actions taken were not genuine or were not for a legitimate objective."
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The ?intent? implied in the ?previous sentence does not have to be pre?mediated but does have to be present.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Thus an action that results from an accident is unlikely to be a sufficient pre?condition.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For example a major institution that, by their sheer size and buying quantity, drives up the price of a security cannot be said to have created a false or misleading appearance of that security."
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This is because their objective was to make an investment with a view to make a profit.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Similarly, an investor who e?mails a broker a market order with one zero too many in the quantity to buy and the broker executes it affecting the price of that stock, the investor cannot be said to have created a false or misleading appearance of that security."
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"However, an investor who buys shares in order to keep a price above a certain level so that the banks or finance companies will not require more collateral (as part of a share financing transaction), is creating a false and misleading appearance with respect to the price of those shares."
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This is because the primary objective was not to make an investment but 17. to keep the price of that security from declining.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Similarly a buyer, who insists on making significant trades towards the end of each trading day and without any good or apparent reason, would be said to be creating a false and misleading appearance with respect to the market of those shares."
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The securities market in Singapore would view both these transactions as a form of market manipulation.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Close orders do not make sense unless it is seen in the context of the Leong Group trying to keep the price 6 of 12Private & Confidential ACH Investments Pte Ltd DRAFT of the Shares firm and/or the traded volume of the Shares high and/or to offer upside support for the market of the Shares.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Close operates for 6 minutes only, compared to the normal trading day of some 6.5 hours."
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Traders buy or sell when liquidity is highest in order to prevent their actions from adversely affecting a share price and thus their cost or return.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Thus traders trade primarily during normal trading hours.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Close primarily to fill orders that could not be completed prior to normal trading hours closing.

report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,"Close and normal trading hours) this means that the Leong Group had access to 7,410 (19 days * 6.5 hours * 60 minutes) normal trading minutes and access to 114 (19 days * 6 minutes)"
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,On this basis the Leong Group was about 30 times more active during the Pre?Close than during normal trading hours.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,Close orders were entered at least 1 bid higher than the last traded price before the Pre?Close.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Close and given that this must mean the Leong Group would have paid more than need be for a large part of their Shares.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The trading pattern of the Leong Group does not make sense.

report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,,The pattern is repeated in the third lot of sales starting the 6 June 2002.
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,,These Shares were sold at around 23.5 cents.

report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"On those days, the Leong Group must have pushed up the price of the Shares by one spread or more."
report02.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"If the Leong Group had not traded on these days, the traded volume of the Shares would have been lower and the price of the Shares would likely have been lower."

report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Given paragraphs 11 to 15 below, it is difficult to envisage how the actions and transactions of the Ng Group could not have affected the price and volume of the Shares."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The Ng Group traded? on a significant number of days during the Relevant Period.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There were 273 trading days during the Relevant Period.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"During this time the Ng Group: a. bought on 250 days; b. sold on 183 days; and c. traded on, meaning bought or sold or bought & sold, on 260 days."

report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,The Ng Group traded 191.4 million shares or about 27.9% of all the Shares then in existence.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This is a large percentage for a single group given that Autron is a medium sized company with limited free float and despite the fact that Relevant Period spanned 13 months.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The Ng Group was a significant trader on select days and throughout the Relevant Period.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,A profile of the Ng Group?s trades relative to the total traded volume of the same day on which they traded is shown below and as Table 2.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"On 32 days, the number of Shares bought by the Ng Group only, accounted for more than 50% of that day?s traded volume."

report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Below 10% Did not Buy or Sell or Trade, respectivel 23"
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Many market professionals believe that once a single party exceeds 30% of the traded volume of a security, that party will influence and have an effect on the traded volume of that security, and through the traded volume have an effect on the price of the security."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For example if the single party sold more than 30% of one day?s volume, that party is likely to have a lowering or depressing effect on the price of the security by virtue of providing a significant amount of supply."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"The degree of influence or effect that the single party exerts depends on the liquidity of the security, how closely the security is followed, how many days the single party represents more than 30% of trade volume, if there is another significant buyer or seller in the market, other news & background information and other factors."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Given 13(b), the Ng Group was a significant buyer of the Shares on 77 days (namely 32 + 45 days) and a significant seller on 67 days (namely 24 + 43 days)."

report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In Table 3 and given 13(b), it can be seen that on 55 days (being 12 + 43 days) the Ng Group would have influenced third party demand."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This represents some 75.1% of the 273 trading days in the Relevant Period.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Close is meant for completing orders outstanding, this is a very large number of days and a very significant percentage of the Relevant Period."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,"The Ng Group placed net buy orders for some 34.6 million and, with orders brought forward from the period before the Pre?Close, bought about 33.5 million Shares during the Pre?"
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,,Ng Group parties bought about 41.4 million shares during the Pre?
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The Ng Group thus was a very significant buyer during the Pre?
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,Close period accounting for some 44.7% of the buying volume during the Relevant Period.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"To my mind ""a false or misleading appearance"" implies that in some way actions taken were not genuine or were not for a legitimate objective."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The ?intent? implied in the previous sentence does not have to be pre?mediated but does have to be present.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Thus an action that results from an accident is unlikely to be a sufficient pre?condition.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For example a major institution that, by their sheer size and buying quantity, drives up the price of a security cannot be said to have created a false or misleading appearance of that security."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This is because their objective was to make an investment with a view to make a profit.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Similarly, an investor who e?mails a broker a market order with one zero too many in the quantity to buy and the broker executes it affecting the price of that stock, the investor cannot be said to have created a false or misleading appearance of that security."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"However, an investor who buys shares in order to keep a price above a certain level so that the banks or finance companies will not require more collateral (as part of a share financing transaction), is creating a false and misleading appearance with respect to the price of those shares."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This is because the primary objective was not to make an investment but to keep the price of that security from declining.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Similarly a buyer who insists on making significant trades towards the end of each trading day and without any good or apparent reason, would be said to be creating a false and misleading appearance with respect to the market of those shares."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The securities market in Singapore would view both these transactions as a form of market manipulation.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,A legitimate objective is trading to make a profit.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The Ng Group were very active traders of the Shares during the Relevant Period.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"On this basis, the Ng Group could claim to have been day traders or short?term traders."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Day traders are risk conscious and as a result keep no or very little stock at the end of each day.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Beyond active trading, the Ng Group actions do not suggest that they were either day traders or short term traders."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The results of my analysis of the specific actions and transactions of the Ng Group calls into question whether the Ng Group intended to make a profit from trading.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In fact, the actions and transactions of the Ng Group make no commercial sense unless it is seen in the context of the Ng Group trying to keep the price firm and/or the traded volume high and/or to offer upside support for the market of the Shares."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The overall profile of the Ng Group?s trades is unusual.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"As can be seen in Table 4, the Ng Group?s buying was biased towards higher prices whilst the Ng Group?s selling was biased towards lower prices."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"To make a profit, a reverse of this profile would be required."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The spreads that the Ng Group traded the Shares on were very thin, meaning the Ng Group typically bought and sold the Shares with a difference of between $0.005 and $0.01 only."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This is because of brokerage commission, exchange fees, financing fees, GST and other transactional costs."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The Ng Group?s pattern of trading and significant holding of Shares at any one time would suggest that they were not normal or typical day traders.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The specific trades that were executed by the Ng Group make little or no commercial sense unless it is seen in the context of the Ng Group trying to keep the price and market of the Shares firm.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Once costs are deducted the sale would have netted a profit of some $9,000 against a capital risk of nearly $1.2 million."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Tight but could be commercially justifiable. 0.17 means from 17 cents to just below 18 cents.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,After cost there would be virtually no profit and possibly a loss.

report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"I note that on the previous day the Ng Group bought 300,000 Share at $0.245 and 52,000 Shares at $0.25."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"When there is no change in beneficial ownership, married deals are normally done at the lowest possible price to minimise brokerage and other costs as these are computed on the number of shares trades times the price they were crossed at."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Do not see the commercial logic especially in the light of the trades undertaken on 20 May 2002.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,After cost there would be virtually no profit and possibly a loss.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"However, I note that the Ng Group bought 22,000 Shares at $0.255 and 400,000 Shares at $0.25 the day before."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Further sell trades show similar or even more bizarre characteristics.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The first 1,000 trades undertaken by the Ng Group is shown in Appendix 2. 18."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Close orders do not make sense unless it is seen in the context of the Ng Group trying to keep the price firm an/or the traded volume high and/or to offer upside support for the market of the Shares firm.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Close operates for 6 minutes only, compared to normal trading of some 7 hours."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Traders buy or sell when liquidity is highest in order to prevent their actions from adversely affecting a share price and thus their cost or return.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Thus traders trade primarily during normal trading hours.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Close primarily to fill orders that could not be completed prior to normal trading hours closing. .
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,As noted in paragraph 15 this was a very large number of days. .
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The Ng Group bought some 33.5 million Shares during the Pre?

report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,Thus the Ng Group accounted for some 44.7% of all purchases undertaken during the Pre?Close.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,As the Ng Group bought on 250 days during normal hours and 205 days during the Pre?
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Close this means that the Ng Group had access to 97,500 normal trading minutes and access to 1,230 Pre?"
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs shares traded by the rest of the market during normal market hour,"On this basis the Ng Group traded about 1,374 Shares per normal trading minute and 27,261 Shares per 8 of 35Private & Confidential ACH Investments Pte Ltd DRAFT 19."

report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"To my mind, the words ""market"" and ""price"" used in the Terms of Reference means either the price of the Shares or the traded volume of the Shares, as ""market"" can be defined as the price times the traded volume."

report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The Ng Group?s trades were a very significant percentage of total trade during the whole of the Relevant Period.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The Ng Group?s trades also dominated the Shares traded or were a significant percentage of Shares traded on a large number of individual days during the Relevant Period.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The Ng Group?s trades dominated Pre?
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Close trades on large number of individual days during the Relevant Period and for whole of the Relevant Period.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"As the vast majority of these trades were buys and the bulk of the orders were placed at 1 bid higher than the last traded price before the Pre? Close, the Ng Group?s trades would have put upward pressure on the closing price of the Shares on large number of individual days during the Relevant Period and for whole of the Relevant Period."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"If the Ng Group had not traded, the traded volume of the Shares would have been lower and the price of the Shares would likely have been lower."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Most investors would thus have been misled with respect to the price, liquidity and market of the Shares."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Given the Points 19(a) to 19 (c), one would expect that the price of the Shares will correlate in some manner with the actions of the Ng Group?s trades."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The correlation need not be direct nor the relationship linear.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In the Chart below, the price of the Shares relative to the STI was plotted against the cumulative holding of the Ng Group."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Relative price of the Shares to the STI was used to remove as much of the background ?noise? as possible.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In other words, the relative history provides a view of the performance of the Share excluding as many other factors as possible."
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The cumulative holding of Ng Group was used since the larger the holding the ?less? stock there is available to the market.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,What we want to judge is whether this reduction in supply affects the price of the Shares as 19(a) to 19 (c) suggest they should.
report03.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The chart reflects what one would expect given 19(a) to 19 (c).

report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In brief, market manipulation occurs where the free market forces of demand and supply are interrupted by a party or parties (acting in conjunction) who are intent on influencing the price of the security in the absence of any value relevant information."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The key difference between insider trading and market manipulation is that in the case of the former, value relevant information exists but is hidden from the market."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,In the case of the latter there is no value relevant information.
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Because it is widely accepted that prices are information revealing"" there is an incentive for some parties to trade as if they were privy to information in order to induce others to trade °"
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Because information is a decaying product, holders of value relevant information must use it or lose it."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"However, in the process of using it, that is, trading, the information becomes impounded in price."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,With respect to price there are generally two types of manipulation.
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Manipulation at the close and manipulation involving related parties.
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Manipulation at the close usually takes the form of limited trading activity, but with any market participant, to affect the price at the close of trading? ."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Conducting such transactions as near as possible to the close of trading limits the amount of trading required to affect price, and in turn, the loss when the stock reverts to its normal price in subsequent trading periods""."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The latter type of manipulation usually involves sustained trading volume over longer periods but with related parties.
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"While there is no indisputable method for determining what does or does not constitute trading or order placement likely to cause a false or misleading appearance, my work with 9 national exchanges and 3 national regulators, suggests that there are 3 practical heuristics that can be used to help establish whether trading behaviour is potentially manipulative at the close in a relevant sense for the purposes of section 97 (1) of the Securities Industry Act. The first element is to establish that trading activity leads to a price that is statistically unusual when judged against trades over a benchmark period."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"As a practical rule, this involves identifying trades that are in the top 1% of prices over a benchmark period, usually 1 month prior and subsequent to the event."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Such trades would qualify for treatment as statistically unusual, warranting a search for value creating information."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,If none is to be found then the likelihood is market manipulation.
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,A second element for identifying potentially manipulative behaviour at the close is to identify trades that break through the available best bid/ask to establish new best bid/asks.
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The more price steps that are broken through in the absence of information the greater the likelihood of manipulation.

report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"A third element for identifying potentially manipulative behaviour at the close is to identify trading circumstances that push the price to a level that is not sustained when the market re? opens, excluding the trading activity of the party suspected of manipulation."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In my opinion, the presence of all three elements referred to above are required before one can make the claim that trading is likely to be manipulative in a relevant sense for the purposes of section 97 (1) of the Securities Industry Act (i.e. that it created, or caused to be created or was calculated to create, a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for, or the price of, the relevant securities)."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For practical purposes I take the phrase ""to create a false and misleading appearance"" to mean that the price of the security at the close did not reflect the broader markets? view of the underlying value of the securities."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,As a practical matter this is determined by identifying the disproportionate influence of one investor at the close coupled with what a reasonable person might describe as a highly unusual trading circumstance.
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The latter is determined by reference first to a rise in the price of a security at the end of a trading session and a subsequent price reversal at the beginning of the next trading session.
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"To address this issue, I have analysed how unusual the traded price is with reference to all prices over the month before and after the trading in question"" and the volume?weighted average price (VWAP) from the start of the trading day to immediately prior to the unusual trading behaviour."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In this case although the trading volume seems large, it is worth noting that given where the price ended up had this been tried earlier in the day, it would almost certainly have cost significantly more to keep at the price at these levels."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There is reasoned argument to suggest that this should be extended to a month either side of the suspicious trading however I have chosen to use the one month period prior to trading as choosing a prior trading period is the most common approach currently in use.
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The second element for deciding whether an order strategy is manipulative is to identify whether the order behaviour led to the trade breaking through a best bid/ask to establish new bids and asks.
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In my opinion, the trading activity must as a minimum break through the best bid/ask in order to be regarded as potentially manipulative."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"The greater the number of price steps broken through beyond the best bid/ask the higher the likelihood of manipulation, in the absence of value relevant information."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Subsequent Trades Revert to Benchmark Levels Assuming criteria 1 and 2 can be established in relation to a particular trading incident, the final element in deciding whether manipulative behaviour may be apparent is verifying that trading in subsequent periods returns to the benchmark against which the trade was judged to be unusual in the first instance."
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,I preface this comment by adding that one would need to exclude the potential manipulator?s trades in the subsequent trading sessions to properly identify whether the trading reverted to pre incident price levels.
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The results of my analysis are as follows.
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,I attach graphs to depict the security?s trading behaviour around the incident and to demonstrate the price levels that were attained comparative to the benchmarks.
report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Further, I provide the worksheets labelled "" CHART .xis"" which summarises the characteristics of all trades in the last 10 minutes of trading on 31 May 2000."

report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This program centres all trading around the bid?ask spread.

report04.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Prices are on the vertical axis and the black component of the visualisation between the red and green areas constitutes the bid/ask spread and each of the circlesrepresents trades, with the size of the circle signifying the volume of the trade."

report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,The latter announcement would have been seen as price positive by investors as a hold especially given the price fall after the SGX announced that it was commencing investigations.

report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The first phase is to accumulate a meaningful long position for the day.
report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,Create false impression,"This is usually done by buying stock at the market price while at the same time putting up large sell orders in the sell queue, the latter to create the impression that there were more sellers so that they can accumulate their long positions."

report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In Period II and Period III, the commencement of action was the withdrawal of large sell orders, ie to remove a perceived overhang."
report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,Show true intention of selling by withrwaling best bid and immediately place sell orders at best ask and get fulfilled immediately,This was immediately followed by the placing of large buy orders but these buy orders were usually pushed down the bid queue to ensure that they were not transacted but at the same time to maintain the perception of a large and growing perceived buying interest in the stock.
report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This pattern was evident during all three periods under review on April 24, 2002."
report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"It is evident from the actual actions taken, which include: a) placing of large sell orders when the five were accumulating the stock to create an impression of large selling pressure."
report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This action was done to 13induce other investors to sell their shares as the stock price could fall further b) placing of large and growing buy orders but not at the front end of the queue to create the impression of growing demand for the stock.
report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This would imply positive price action and would have induced less well informed investors to buy the share even when the five proprietary traders were net sellers of the stock c) the sudden removal of their buy orders on the queue when a large buyer ( emerged (or the removal of buy orders when they wanted to clear the / Buy queue confirming that they had no intention to BUY shares.)
report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The emergence of large buyers could have been induced by the perception that demand for the shares was rising.
report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"It is my opinion that the action of the five proprietary traders was to designed or engineered to create a false and misleading picture as to the actual demand or supply in the market for Dayen shares on April 24, 2002 during the three Periods in question."
report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,Create false impression,"This is because the impression created by their actions was the opposite of their actual intention, ie that there were big sellers when in fact the five were net buyers in the early accumulation stages; and this subsequently changed to an impression that there were big buyers when in fact the five proprietary traders were net sellers."
report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,Create false impression,These buy and sell actions also created the impression of heightened investor interests in the stock of terms of trading momentum.
report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,To the best of my knowledge there were no fundamental reasons in terms of corporate announcements that day about the actual business of Dayen that would havs supported such a strong positive intra?day price gain of 20.7% even as the Straits Times index fell 5.7 points or just under 1%.
report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,While it is harder to ascertain whether their actions actually induced other investors to either buy or sell shares depending of which phase of the intra?day trading cycle they were involved in.
report05.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"The circumstantial evidence that the shares actually moved in the direction, which the five intended, because of a created perception of growing momentum (buy or sell} caused by their trading activity is reasonably compelling given that the high beta and positive SGX announcement would have attracted interest from proprietary traders and contra?traders."

report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The only difference is that Jade share price fell very much more during this period.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"For example, Jade share price fell by a hefty 67.3% over 12 this one month, from $0.275 on 2 January 2008 to $0.090 on 30 January 2008."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"The UOBDAQ, STI-SmallCap and the STI also fell but by a lesser (though still significant) 23.2%, 21.9% and 12.9%, respectively."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,The DJI also fell but managed to recover towards the end of the month and only ended down 4.6% over the one month period.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"The biggest price fall for Jade over this month occurred on 21 and 22 January 2008 when it dropped 25.6% (from $0.215 to $0.160) and 34.4% (from $0.160 to $0.105), respectively (or a decrease of 51.2% over the 2 days)."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This coincided with big falls in stock prices in Asia and Europe due to fears of a recession in the US that could spread worldwide.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"The UOBDAQ, STI-SmallCap and STI fell between 1.7% and 7.4% on each day (or a total of between 7.7% and 12.8% over the 2 days)."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,The US market was closed on 21 January 2008 due to a holiday but was down 1.1% (based on the DJI) on 22 January 2008.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The fall in the price of Jade was thus more pronounced and could have been due to some company-specific issue.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The steep fall in Jade share price over these 2 days came after the Company made an announcement on 20 January 2008 that Jade and E3 Holdings (a company related to Dr Anthony Soh) would jointly acquire a 49% stake in an oil refinery in China and a 100% stake in a piece of land nearby in Jilin province.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,Jade would have to pay RMB66.1million (S$13.2million) in cash and assume RMB101.2million (S$20.2million) in debt as its share of the acquisition.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,"The announced acquisition was 1.93 times the Company?s shareholders? funds (according to its 2007 Annual Report) of S$17.3million and thus might have been significant news to market participants (I use the term ?market participants? to mean common investors, retail traders, and speculators, etc)."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In addition, I have been provided with information that Australian securities broking company, Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd (?Opes?), had on 21 January 2008 force sold 4.6 million Jade shares to meet margin calls on APLL."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,But the size of the sale was significant as it constituted more than 20% of the total 13 trading volume in Jade on 21 January 2008.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The force-sale could have contributed to downward pressure on the share prices of 21 January 2008 and carried over into 22 January 2008.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"While Jade share price during this period continued to follow the general price trends of similar shares upwards as represented by the UOBDAQ and STI-SmallCap, the magnitude of each price increase (in percentage terms) of Jade shares was more than 25 times larger."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"On the whole, the share price of Jade jumped 95% compared with a 3.6% increase in the UOBDAQ and a 3.3% rise in the STI-SmallCap."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"On the other hand, the STI and the DJI were down 1.1% and 0.8%, respectively."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,"There were no major announcements by the Company during this period, except for one on 12 February 2008 on the proposed disposal of JPE, the loss-making subsidiary that makes leadframes."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,But it is difficult to determine if this announcement contributed to the upward trend of Jade prices when Jade?s share price actually dropped $0.01 from $0.205 to $0.195 the day after this announcement and there was no other news that day that appeared to be a contributing factor to the drop.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As it stands, there seemed to be no clear reason for the bigger than normal increase in the share price of Jade."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There is the possibility of speculative buying on rumors (or leaked price-sensitive information) of possible corporate activity regarding Jade.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,"On 18 February 2008, APLL (the ?Offeror?) announced through OCBC Bank that it was making an Offer for all of Jade shares it did not own at $0.225 a share."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,"In the announcement, OCBC Bank also confirmed that APLL had sufficient financial resources to pay in full all acceptances of the offer."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,"The offer price of $0.225 was stated in the announcement to have a premium of 15.4% over the last transacted price (13 February 2008), and a premium of 59.1% and 17.3% over the volume-weighted average price for 14 the one and three month period, respectively, prior to the announcement."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"Also, the offer price of $0.225 was stated as having a premium of 1,096.8% over the audited net tangible asset per share as at 29 September 2007."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Take-over offers of shares of companies listed on the Singapore Exchange are governed by rules found in the Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers (?the Code?, the version in force was that dated 15 March 2007)."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"When a person (or persons acting in concert with him) a) holding less than 30% of the voting rights acquires additional shares which results in him owning 30% or more of the voting rights, or b) holding more than 30% voting rights but less than 50% acquires, in any 6 months period, additional shares carrying more than 1% of the voting rights, he is obliged to extend a general offer (?GO?) to all shareholders."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This is referred to as a mandatory GO and comes under Rule 14.1.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"A mandatory GO must be paid in cash, and the offer price must not be less than the highest price paid by the offeror (or persons acting in concert) during the offer period and 6 months preceding it."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"On the other hand, a person who has not incurred an obligation to make a mandatory GO may choose to make a voluntary offer."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In that case, he has to abide by Rule 15.1 of the Code on voluntary GOs."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"A voluntary GO can be paid in cash or securities or both, and the offer price must not be less than the highest price paid by the offeror (or his concert parties) during the offer period and 3 months preceding it."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Whether a GO is mandatory or voluntary, it is conditional on the offeror receiving acceptances of more than 50% of the voting rights, after which the offer becomes unconditional."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This is to ensure that the successful offeror will ultimately have control (i.e. more than 50%) of the Company after the take-over exercise.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If the amount of acceptances is such that the Offeror?s total shareholdings in Jade shares, after the Offer 15 closes, will be less than 50% the Offer is considered to have failed and the acceptances will be treated as cancelled."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For both the mandatory and voluntary GO, Rule 3.5 of the Code requires a confirmation to be made upfront by an appropriate third-party (eg. a bank or financial adviser) that the offeror has sufficient financial resources to settle in full in the event that all acceptances of the offer take place."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This is an important requirement to ensure that the GO will not fail because of a lack of funding.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Most mandatory GOs are launched with the intention of gaining majority control of the listed company.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As such, the offer price is normally set at a level above the prevailing market price of the share to encourage a higher level of acceptance by existing shareholders."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"However, there are some mandatory GOs that are carried out not because the offerors wanted majority control."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"It could be a simple case of someone acquiring additional shares as a result of which Rule 14.1 of the Code is triggered, requiring the person to make a mandatory GO."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"An example of this would be the opportunistic acquisition, say, of a block of shares put on the market (by a fund manager or strategic investor, say)."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Let?s say the transacted price is at or near the prevailing market price of the share and the buyer (whether new or an existing shareholder) has no intention of gaining majority control (as he is happy with the current management, say), then the offer price he would set for this mandatory GO is likely to be low (although not lower than his purchase price)."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"With a low offer price, acceptances would likely be low."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"On the other hand, voluntary GOs are carried out not compelled by the requirements of the Code but ?voluntarily? by someone wishing to gain majority control of the listed company."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,An example of this is the voluntary conditional cash offer by APPL for Jade Technology Holdings Ltd (?Jade?).
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In fact, some voluntary GOs are launched by existing substantial/majority shareholders with the intention of de-listing the company and taking it private."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As the objective of voluntary GOs is to ultimately have majority (or even 100%) control of the listed company, the offer price is usually set significantly above the prevailing market price of the share so that existing shareholders will find it attractive and hence accept the offer."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Offer was priced at a premium of 15.4% over the last transacted price of $0.195 on 13 February 2008 and 17.3% above the 3-month volume weighted price of Jade shares.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"It was also a hefty 59.1% premium over the 1-month volume weighed price of Jade shares and 1,096.8% premium over the net tangible asset per share."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The offer price of $.225 would therefore be considered attractive.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Acceptances for the Offer would be expected to be high.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Since it was announced in the Offer document that APLL already owned around 46.54% of Jade shares, the chances of APLL gaining 50% or more of the voting rights of the Company would also be high, which would likely make the Offer turn unconditional."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"As a third party financial adviser or bank (OCBC in this case) confirmed that the offeror had the financial resources to cover all acceptances in full, market participants would, therefore, expect that, if they could not sell Jade shares at a higher price in the market, they would be able to sell them at $0.225 to the Offeror by accepting the Offer."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,"Having regard to the prevailing market conditions, what effect did APPL?s voluntary conditional cash offer for Jade which was formally announced by OCBC Bank on 18 February 2008 on behalf of APLL have on the market for, or the price of, Jade shares?"
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Offer for Jade shares was announced on 18 February 2008.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The last trading day for Jade shares before this announcement was 13 February 2008 (there was a trading halt on 14&15 February 2008 called by the Company, and 16&17 February 2008 were on the weekend)."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The price of Jade shares had closed at $0.195 at the end of trading on 13 February 2008.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"The Offer price of $0.225 meant that there was a price difference (premium) of $0.030, or 15.4% above the last traded price of $0.195."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,This price difference would likely attract a lot of buying interest for Jade shares from market participants when trading started again on 19 February 2008.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,This was because it would be profitable for someone to buy Jade shares at this price ($0.195) and selling them to APLL by accepting the Offer at the offer price of $0.225.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For example, if a person bought 100,000 Jade shares at $0.195 and subsequently accepted the Offer, he could make a profit of around $3,000, less the trading costs of his purchase (there is no cost involved in accepting the Offer)."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In fact, even if the price of Jade shares were to rise to $0.220 it would still be profitable for someone to buy them and sell them to the Offeror at the offer price of $0.225, as the cost of his purchase would only be around slightly less than $0.001 per share (an estimate based on 100,000 Jade shares purchased, and assuming a brokerage charge of around 0.375% for such trades and the usual clearing and miscellaneous fees and GST)."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"So buying at $0.220 and selling to the Offeror at $0.225 would give a profit of around $0.004 per Jade share or $400 for the 100,000 shares purchased."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"So not only would retail traders and speculators be interested to buy Jade shares when the Offer was announced, but investors who commonly invest in shares (or ?common investors?) would also be attracted to buy the shares as the premium in the Offer price over the prevailing market price meant that there was certainty of a profit."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Although common investors normally trade on a longer term basis, they would not shy away from good profit opportunities when they arose (as in the case of a voluntary conditional cash offer, which is quite different from speculative trades)."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Thus the Offer would likely increase the demand for Jade shares and raise its price.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As for the common investors, there could be other reasons why they would be attracted to the Offer."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Firstly, the Offer was made by none other than APLL, a company owned and controlled by Dr Anthony Soh who was also a Director and Group President of Jade."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This would be considered positive news for Jade.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"These common investors would expect Dr Anthony Soh to know what he was doing when he decided to make the Offer through APLL since he not only had the inside knowledge of Jade?s business and operations, but also its future profitability and growth prospects."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Secondly, these common investors would have noted Dr Anthony Soh?s announcements in Jade?s 2007 Annual Report that net after-tax loss had been reduced to only $0.5 million in the year ended September 2007 from $$1.4 million in 2006 and $7.2 million in 2005."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,"In the 2007 Annual Report, Dr Anthony Soh also announced that Jade would be shifting its focus to new business like commodities and resources development and real estate and property development."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,"In January 2008, Jade announced that it was going into the business of marketing, distribution, logistics and supply chain management and even asset and investment management and investor relations, advisory and consultancy services."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,"From 4 December 2007 to 21 December 2007, Jade had also made various announcements of proposed business deals with Russian, Chinese and Indonesian parties, although none of these deals appeared to have been finalized at that time."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,"The last announcement made by Jade, before the Offer was announced, was on 12 February 2008."

report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Since there was no price-sensitive information released by Jade to the public during this time, and the rapid increase in price could not be ascribed to developments in the general market, the reason for the price surge could only be because of speculative buying on rumors (or possibly leaked price-sensitive information) of some corporate activities regarding Jade."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"While the proposed business deals and new business activities did not appear to have much impact on the price of Jade shares when they were announced, the rapid rise in the share price of Jade during the period 31 January 2008 to 13 February 2008 could hint of some positive developments in the Company (although, as mentioned above, it might have been due to market speculation)."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,"However, when APLL announced the Offer for Jade shares at $0.225, it would likely cause common investors to interpret it as a signal or even confirmation that Jade might, at last, be on track in turning around its business."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,It would likely have given the impression that Dr Anthony Soh was now confident enough about Jade?s business and prospects as to consider increasing his stake in Jade by launching this Offer through APLL.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Under these circumstances, therefore, the announcement of APLL?s Offer would likely attract common investors to buy and invest in Jade shares."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The Offer by APLL would likely attract a lot of interest from both retail traders and speculators and common investors to buy Jade shares, and consequently increase the demand and market for and price of Jade shares."

report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"It would appear, therefore, that the substantial increase both in the price of Jade shares and daily trading volume on 19 February 2008 was not due to any macro- economic factors affecting stock markets in general, but by some company-specific 21 development."

report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"From the evidence above, the price increase in Jade shares over this 2-week period could not be explained in terms of the general market conditions at that time."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"It had, therefore, to be due to something company-specific."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,But there was no bullish information about the Company in the market that could positively influence the trading and price of Jade shares during this period.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,There were 3 announcements made during this period and they were: Date & Time of Announcement Subject Matter 1) 31 January 2008 (05:52:26PM) Incorporation of 100%-owned subsidiary 2) 12 February 2008 (07:42:30PM) Proposed disposal of Jade Precision Engineering Pte Ltd 26 3) 13 February 2008 (02:41:06PM) Request for suspension 72.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,A copy of these Announcements can be found in Appendices E ? G. 73.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Firstly, the incorporation of a wholly-owned subsidiary, Jade Capital Management Pte Ltd, on 31 January 2008 with the intention of carrying out a new activity like asset and capital management, etc., could not have positively impacted the trading and price of Jade, as the business had not commenced."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Secondly, on 12 February 2008, the Company announced that it was proposing the disposal of Jade Precision Engineering Pte Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Since this subsidiary was loss-making, the proposal to sell off this business would sound positive for the Company."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"But, contrary to that, Jade share price fell $0.010 the next day from $0.205 to $0.195."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,"Finally, the 13 February 2008 announcement was only for trading suspension (pending the Offer announcement)."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Based on information available, I can only conclude that the substantial increase in the price of Jade shares during this 2-week period could have been due to speculative buying on rumors (or possibly leaked price-sensitive information) of some corporate activity involving Jade."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"During the period between 21 February 2008 and 17 March 2008, information that Asia Pacific Links Ltd did not have sufficient financial resources to implement its voluntary conditional cash offer for all ordinary issued shares of Jade in full (the ?insufficient financial resources information?), would a reasonable person in possession of the above information expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of Jade shares?"
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Importance of Having Sufficient Financial Resources 75.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"To ensure that a take-over offer will not fail because of a lack of funds, Rule 3.5 of the Code states that ?Where the offer is for cash or involves an element of cash, the 27 announcement of an offer should include an unconditional confirmation by the financial adviser or by another appropriate third party that the offeror has sufficient financial resources available to satisfy full acceptance of the offer."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This is an important assurance to shareholders that whoever accepts the offer will be paid in full by the Offeror.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This would be an important consideration for not only existing shareholders who look forward to accepting the offer but also new buyers of the offeree?s shares, especially those who had bought the shares with a view to selling them subsequently to the Offeror (by accepting the Offer) for profit, in the knowledge that they would be able to ?square off? their positions without fear of a default in payment."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In the case of APLL?s Offer, this confirmation was provided by OCBC, a reputable bank in Singapore."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This would add a level of comfort to shareholders and market participants to the Offer and enhance the credibility of APLL.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As the Offer was conditional upon APLL obtaining 50% or more of the voting rights in Jade, acceptances would be honored only when this threshold was reached."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In the event that APLL failed to gain the 50% or more voting rights in Jade after the close of the Offer period, then the Offer would be deemed withdrawn and all acceptances cancelled."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"But as mentioned earlier, APLL?s Offer was considered attractive and hence the probability of the threshold being crossed would be high."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,What would happen if it subsequently turned out that APLL did not have sufficient financial resources to implement the Offer for Jade shares in full?
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If that was the case, APLL would not have available funds to pay for all acceptances of Jade shares."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This would mean that the Offer or the whole take-over exercise would be at risk of failing.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Market participants would want to know the reason for the sudden change in APLL?s financial position and if the Offer would be called off.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The uncertainty would be very bad for the market.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Existing shareholders looking forward to accepting the Offer 28 would now be confused and uncertain if their acceptances would be honored.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Buyers of Jade shares, especially those intending to make a profit by subsequently selling the shares back to APLL (by accepting the Offer), would be shocked and uncertain if they would be able to ?square off? their long positions."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The usual reaction to such uncertainty would be to quickly dispose of their shares in the market to avoid a loss or minimize loss.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The resulting selling pressure would rapidly depress the price of Jade shares.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Even the common investor would react negatively by selling their holding of Jade shares irrespective of whether they bought them for quick profit or based on fundamentals.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This is because the revelation of APLL?s lack of financial resources would mean that the financial position of APLL had weakened suddenly and significantly, and that the Offer might be in jeopardy."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There would not only be doubts cast on the credibility of APLL and Dr Anthony Soh but also ultimately on Jade.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In addition, common investors would know that the resulting heavy selling of Jade shares would depress the price of Jade shares significantly, possibly pushing it back to its pre-Offer level or even lower."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,A common investor would not be likely to sit still and do nothing under such circumstances.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Instead, they would likely adopt the ?play-it-safe? attitude by taking the ?sell first and find out later? approach."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Also, potential buyers would likely hold back their purchases."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This would depress the price of Jade shares even further.

report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The actual effect on the price of Jade shares after the revelation of the ?insufficient financial resources information? could be seen from the trading of Jade shares on 7 April 2008, the first trading day after the announced withdrawal of the Offer on 5 April 2008 (6 April 2008 being a weekend)."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"According to the announcement (a copy is attached as Appendix H), APLL was required, by reason of events relating to Opes, to have additional financial resources to satisfy full acceptances of the Offer."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"But due to the sudden and unexpected turn of events, APLL was not able to obtain an unconditional confirmation from an appropriate third party that there were available funds to satisfy full acceptances of the Offer."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As a result, the Offer was withdrawn."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"On 7 April 2008, Jade shares opened for trading at the low price of $0.080 and experienced heavy selling before closing down a hefty $0.155 or 70.5%, from $0.220 on 1 April 2008 to $0.065 on 7 April 2008 (there was a trading halt on 2-4 April 2008, and 5&6 were the weekend)."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"A total of 166.2 million shares were traded on this day, which was more than twice the volume of shares traded (of 81.8 million) on the first day after the initial Offer announcement."

report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"It is clear from the evidence above that the hefty fall in the price of Jade shares could not be attributed to conditions prevailing in the markets in general, or other macro- economic factors."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"It had to do with something specifically related to the Company and, at that time, the only new information was the announcement of the withdrawal of APLL?s Offer for Jade shares due to insufficient financial resources."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The market impact evidence above clearly showed that the ?insufficient financial resources information? did, in fact, had a significant effect on the price or value of Jade shares."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Based on the analysis above, my opinion is as follows: a."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"From the evidence, it was clear that the announcement that APLL was withdrawing its Offer for Jade shares due to insufficient financial resources on 5 April had caused heavy selling of Jade shares on the next trading day, and this had resulted in a significant drop in the price of Jade shares."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"When this information was made generally available via APLL?s announcement on 5 April 2008, there was heavy selling of Jade shares on the next trading day."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As explained above, the selling would likely have come from both retail traders/speculators and common investors alike."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In addition, potential buyers would likely be discouraged from making their purchases."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In my opinion, the information that APLL did not have sufficient financial resources to implement in full, all acceptances of Jade?s shares, if it was made generally available, was likely to effect a significant change in the price or value of Jade shares; and c."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In my opinion, there was a substantial likelihood that the information if it was made generally available, would influence a reasonable investor in 31 deciding whether or not to buy or sell Jade shares; and d."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In my opinion, a reasonable person in possession of the above information would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of Jade shares."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,i. Asia Pacific Links Ltd did not have sufficient financial resources to implement its voluntary conditional cash offer for all ordinary issued shares of Jade in full (the ?insufficient financial resources information?); ii.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,OCBC had received confirmation from Standard Chartered Bank (Jakarta) that it did not issue the financial resources confirmation letter and the banker?s guarantee (the ?SCBJ confirmation that it did not issue the Letter and BG information?) which Asia Pacific Links Ltd previously used as proof that it had sufficient financial resources to satisfy full acceptances of the Offer; iii.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd had gone into receivership on 28 March 2008 and 300,050,000 of Jade shares which Asia Pacific Links Ltd had lent to Opes Prime 32 Stockbroking Ltd pursuant to a share lending agreement may be seized or sold by the creditors of Opes and that APLL may no longer have beneficial ownership of the said shares (the ?Opes receivership and possible seizure and sale of APLL?s Jade shares by Opes? creditors and the uncertainty over APLL?s beneficial ownership of the said Jade shares information?): would a reasonable person possession of the above information expect it (interpreted singly and in combination) to have a material effect on the price or value of Jade shares?"
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Issue Five (i) on the ?insufficient financial resources information? if interpreted singly is similar to that of Issue
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Four and the detailed analysis presented above applies.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,I would like just to state here that my opinion and conclusion are the same.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"From the evidence, it was clear that the announcement that APLL was withdrawing its Offer for Jade shares due to insufficient financial resources on 5 April had caused heavy selling of Jade shares on the following day, and this had resulted in a significant drop in the price of Jade shares."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"When this information was made generally available via APLL?s announcement on 5 April 2008, there was heavy selling of Jade shares on the very next trading day."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"As explained above, the selling would likely come from both retail 33 traders/speculators and common investors alike."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In addition, potential buyers would likely be discouraged from making purchases.;"
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"It is, therefore, my opinion that the information that APLL did not have sufficient financial resources to implement in full all acceptances of Jades shares if it were generally available was likely to effect a significant change in the price or value of Jade shares; and"

report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In my opinion, a reasonable person in possession of the above information would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of Jade shares."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Effect of the ?SCBJ confirmation that it did not issue the Letter and BG information? 90.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,(ii) on the ?SCBJ confirmation that it did not issue the Letter and BG information? if interpreted singly would cast serious doubts on APLL?s Offer.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The denial by SCBJ meant that APLL did not actually have financial support from SCBJ.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Questions would be asked as to whether APLL had the financial standing to find another banker to replace SCBJ (and how soon that can be done) or whether, in fact, APLL did have the financial resources to implement the Offer in full and whether APLL had relied on faked documents."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If this information were to be made generally available, it would likely have a more serious impact on investors than the ?insufficient financial resources information?."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"This is because, in addition to the doubts about the financial resources of APLL, the denial by SCBJ suggested that there was the possibility of fraud being committed as fake documents were used."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If investors became aware that APPL and/or Dr Anthony Soh had shown OCBC fake documents to obtain OCBC?s confirmation that APLL had sufficient financial resources for the take-over exercise, their reaction would be very negative."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"There might also be doubts about the integrity of APLL and/or Dr Anthony Soh, and since he was also a Director and Group President of Jade, questions would be asked of Jade as well."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Market participants, including common investors, would likely react to these doubts and uncertainty by adopting the ?sell first and find out later? attitude."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,They might just ?dump? Jade shares and depress the price of Jade shares.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"My opinions on Issue Five (ii) are, therefore, as follows: a."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The information, that SCBJ did not issue the Letter, Fax and the BG, if made generally available would create not only doubts about APLL?s financial resources and its ability to implement the Offer in full and but also raise questions about the integrity of APLL and/or Dr Anthony Soh."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The uncertainty would likely cause common investors to immediately sell their Jade shares and potential buyers to hold back on their purchases.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Both these actions would depress the price of Jade shares.

report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,A common investor would likely not stand idle in the face of such selling pressure and knowing how this would affect the price of Jade shares.

report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Effect of the ?Opes? receivership and possible seizure and sale of APLL?s Jade shares by Opes? creditors and that APLL may no longer have beneficial ownership of the said Jade shares information? 94.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"I was informed that, although APLL had signed a share lending agreement called the Global Master Securities Lending Agreement (GMSLA) with Opes involving Jade shares, there was no reference to this in the press release on 28 March 2008 by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission when it announced that Opes was placed under receivership the day before."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,A copy of the press release can be found in Appendix I).
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As such, the press release itself would have no effect on APLL?s Offer and the trading of Jade shares."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If, the information in Issue Five (iii) were made generally available, it would likely raise serious questions about not only APLL?s financial position but also the fate of those 300,050,000 Jade shares."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As the amount of Jade shares ?lent? was large, this implied that APLL could have borrowed a substantial sum from Opes."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As the GMSLA had provided for the re-delivery of the Jade shares back to APLL if the loan was repaid, questions would be asked if APLL could come up with the funds within a reasonable time to repay Opes and avoid any force-selling."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Further, if APLL could not repay the loan, then those Jade shares would likely be force-sold by Opes? creditors."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If that happened, there would not be any Jade shares left for re-delivery even if, at a later date, APLL could find the funds for repayment."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"To a common investor who did not have sight of the GMSLA, the above possible events may effectively reduce the percentage shareholding that APLL had in Jade shares."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The above concerns of a common investor would be even greater if he knew of the contents of the GMSLA.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"According to the GMSLA, the beneficial ownership of the 300,050,000 Jade shares was transferred to Opes when the cash or loan proceeds were given to APLL."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"So, those 300,050,000 Jade shares did not actually belong to APLL anymore once the GMSLA was signed and cash paid to APLL."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The beneficial ownership of those Jade shares would no longer be APLL
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,and that would likewise reduce the percentage of shareholding that APLL had of Jade shares.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If market participants were to be aware of the possibility that APLL might have owned less shares in Jade than was announced with the Offer, they would be concerned, as the reduced percentage shareholding meant that APLL?s Offer for Jade shares would now have to be for a larger amount than originally planned."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Would APLL have additional funds to cater for this?
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There would be too many questions and ?ifs? for market participants to consider.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As the loan amount was likely to be substantial and coupled with the serious beneficial 37 ownership issues that needed to be resolved, they would worry that these issues might put APLL"
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Market participants? reaction to such an uncertainty would likely be to ?play it safe? and ?sell first and find out later?.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This rush to sell would result in a drop in the price of Jade shares.
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As for potential buyers, they would likely hold back their purchases."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,My opinions on Issue Five (iii) are as follows:
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The information about Opes? receivership and the possible seizure and sale of Jade shares by Opes? creditors and the uncertainty over beneficial ownership of the 300,050,000 Jade shares, if made generally available, would raise many questions about APLL?s financial position and the percentage shareholding of APLL?s stake in Jade and its ability to fully implement the Offer for Jade shares."
report06.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The serious concerns and uncertainty created would likely cause common investors to immediately sell Jade shares and depress its price.

report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"A list of the announcements are exhibited hereto as Annex B. 4, Assumptions Made 4.1 I have reviewed the orders and trades of John and Lee from the point of view of an ordinary prudent investor, trading rationally and on a commercial basis."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In my Report, I have assumed that trades executed in John?s accounts were John?s trades and, likewise, those executed in Lee?s account were Lee?s trades."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,4.3 I have assumed that the information provided by SGX is accurate.
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As for the Appendices A, B and C given to me, I have verified them and found them to be correct."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Appendix A shows a list of 33 ""Suspicious Trades"" grouped as 16 ""pairs"" of ""Round?Trip Cross Trades"" carried out by John and Lee over 16 days in the Relevant Period."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"15 of the 16 ""pairs"" consist of 2 ""Round?Trip Cross Trades"" each, with the remaining ""pair"" comprising 3 such trades (giving a total of 33 trades)."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"4.3 Appendix B shows a list of 19 ""Suspicious Trades"" done between John and Lee over 17 days, referred to as ""One?Way Cross Trades""."

report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"4.4 Appendix C shows a list of 6 ""Suspicious Trades"" carried out by John with himself as the counter?party, giving rise to the 6 ""Washed"" trades."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,These were done over 4 days in the Relevant Period.
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"I reviewed the Daily Listings of Orders and Trades in Keda shares provided by SGX for the Relevant Period and examined in detail the trades carried out by John and Lee, in particular, with respect to: a the price and volume of their orders and trades; b. the time and sequence of their orders and trades; c."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The Daily Listing of Orders and Trades in Keda shares provided by SGX made it possible to re?construct, chronologically, how John and Lee used their respective securities accounts with Phillip Securities and Lim & Tan Securities to trade in Keda shares during the Relevant Period.19 5.3 In this Report, the time an order was entered or executed plays an important role in the review and has been frequently mentioned in the Report."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The format of 00:00:00 hrs is used.
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Thus, if a trade was done at 10 seconds after 9.30am in the morning, the time of the trade would be shown as 09:30:10 hrs, and likewise, if an order was placed at 4.00pm in the afternoon, the time the order was entered would be shown as 16:00:00 hrs."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"5.4 Also in this Report, ""bid"" refers to the buying price of the share and ""ask"" refers to the selling price of the share."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The best ""bid"" and the best ""ask"" at any particular point in time represent the ""prevailing market"" for that share, and would be indicated as ""bid/ask"" (for example, the prevailing market was $0.085/$0.090 if the best ""bid"" was at $0.085 and best ""ask"" at $0.090)."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For the Relevant Period, the ""bid"" and ""ask"" size for a share priced below a dollar was specified by SGX to be $0.005 or half a cent, as can be seen in the example given."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"By observing how the share was traded and the last done price, investors can, generally, get a feel of the prevailing market sentiment of a share."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For example, all things being equal and irrespective of the overall trend, if a share is traded at the ""ask"" price, it is viewed as more ""bullish"", whereas if it is done at the ""bid"" price, it would be viewed as more ""bearish""."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This is no different from someone looking for an indication of the latest sentiment in the property market.
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If a piece of property is transacted at the seller?s price (""ask""), it meant that the buyer is more keen to buy the property and hence is willing to pay what the seller asks for."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"On the other hand, if the seller is eager20 to dispose of the property and willing to sell to the buyer at the latter?s price (""bid""), then this would be considered more ""bearish""."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"5.6 Therefore, during the course of a trading day, there will always be this interplay of ""bullish"" and ""bearish"" signals which will affect the share market sentiment and hence the trading of the shares."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"All things being equal, a ""bullish"" sentiment would tend to draw in buyers for a particular share whereas a ""bearish"" one would tend to encourage selling (or buying on a more cautious stance)."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,5.7 The closing price (end?of?day price) of a share is an important piece of financial information.
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,It is widely used in charts and technical analysis.
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Investment analysts derive ratios and averages from these closing prices and use them extensively in their investment research and for making investment decisions.

report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Suspicious Modus Operandi The sequence and timing of John?s and Lee?s sell and buy orders had given rise to suspicion.
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,They seemed to have been contrived and carried out in a highly orchestrated manner to ensure that John and Lee ended up trading with one another.
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Because the market for Keda shares was illiquid, John and Lee were able to use these transactions to manipulate the market and raise the price of Keda shares."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In addition, the modus operandi they employed was such that they were able to do this without expending too much resource as in many of these trades no shares actually changed hands between John and Lee, and so no money was needed to be paid out by both John and Lee."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"On the other hand, where it was necessary to pay for the shares to be delivered, John and Lee kept most of their trading volumes small so as to limit their capital outlay."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Lack of Commercial Basis or Unusually Small Volume 10d) Many of the ""Suspicious Trades"" done by John and Lee were found to be lacking in commercial logic and purpose."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In many cases, the buying and selling between John and Lee resulted in the passing of a ""phantom"" block of Keda shares to and fro between John and Lee at the same price."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The net result is that there was no need to deliver or pay for the shares.
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For the remaining cases, they were traded in small volumes (as small as 1 or 2 lots), which is unusual for a penny stock like Keda."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Then there were trades that were carried out by John with himself as the counter?party (so there was no change in the beneficial ownership) without any valid reason;
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Artificially Raising the Closing Price of Keda Shares
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"There was a strong inference that 40 of these 58 ""Suspicious Trades"", were found to have been intentionally carried out as the last trade for the day, resulting in the closing price of Keda shares being artificially raised by between $0.005 and $0.100 or between 1 and 20 ""bids; and Genuineness of Trades in Doubt All 58 ""Suspicious Trades"" were questionable in terms of genuineness, and the manner in which these trades were carried out aroused suspicion."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"These trades either did not 11 2324 make commercial sense, or were of unusually small volume (which makes its purpose suspect) and appeared to have been contrived and deliberately carried out in a coordinated manner."

report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,8.9 Trading to Artificially Raise the Closing Price of Keda Shares 8.9.1
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"As mentioned above, John and Lee had used the 3 different types of trades to artificially raise the closing price of Keda shares on 26 days in the Relevant Period."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"John and Lee used 27 ""Round?Trip Cross Trades"", 10 ""One? Way Cross Trades"" and 3 ""Washed Trades"" to raise the closing price of Keda 1629 shares on 26 days in the Relevant Period."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The details are explained in the following paragraphs.
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"?Trip Cross Trades"" 8.9.2.1 A total of 27 of the 33 ""Round?Trip Cross Trades"" were used by John and Lee to artificially raise the closing price of Keda shares on 13 days in the Relevant Period."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"One ""pair"" of ""Round?Trip Cross Trades"" (or 2 trades) was used on each day, with the exception of 7 August 2008, when 3 trades were used instead."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The 13 days were as follows: 25 June 2008; 23 July 2008; 30 July 2008; 1 August 2008; 7 August 2008; 22 August 2008; 25 September 2008; 6 May 2009; 4 June 2009; 18 August 2009; 27 August 2009; 2 November 2009; and 25 November 2009.
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"8.9.2.2 Each pair of these ""Round?Trip Cross Trades"" trades comprised two ""legs"" as follows: a) First leg of the round?tripping ? a purchase of Keda shares by Lee from John (or the converse); b) _ Second leg of the round tripping ?a subsequent purchase by John from Lee (or the converse)."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"On 7 August 2008, however, the second leg was split into 2 trades, instead of the usual 1 trade."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"The volume and price of the Keda shares traded were identical for both legs, hence the term ""round?tripping""."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,This happened 13 times over 1730 13 days.

report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"The net result was that both John and Lee bought and sold a block of ""phantom"" Keda shares between themselves and at the same price."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Because of the way they traded, there was no need for any of them to own any Keda shares at the outset."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Both of them ended the day with a ""squared"" position in Keda shares and there was no need for either John or Lee to deliver Keda shares or take delivery of them."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,There was also no profit or loss to be accounted for.
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The only impact was an increase in the price of Keda shares over the last done price.
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"John and Lee were found to have employed two distinct trading tactics in carrying out the ""round?tripping"" trades (described as Type 1 and 2 below) to raise the closing price of Keda shares."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Type 1 trades involved the use of two ""parallel"" sell orders and two ""parallel"" buy orders by John and Lee to effect the ""round?tripping""."

report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"10 of the 13 pairs of ""Round?Trip Cross Trades"" which artificially raised the closing price of Keda shares were carried out in this manner."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"1831 8.9.2.6 Type 2 trades, on the other hand, involved the use of alternate sell and buy orders by John and Lee."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"For instance, the process began by the entry of a single sell order by Lee."

report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"8.9.2.7 Type 1 and 2 trades are described in more detail in the following paragraphs and, where appropriate, I have given my comments."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"The ""round?tripping"", in this case, was initiated by John placing a sell order first for a certain volume of Keda shares at a certain price."
report07.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In all instances, the selling price was always fixed at 1 ""bid"" below the prevailing best ""ask"", just so that his sell order was first on the sell queue."

report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"After building a position by buying 250,000 shares at $0.68, LKF took the view that the stock would rise to $0.70 given the more buoyant market sentiment toward water treatment companies."

report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,"It is therefore my opinion that LKF?s trading actions in Dayen on June 26"" 2003 were consistent with acceptable market practice and did not contravene either Section 97 (1) nor Section 98 (1) of the SIA."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,LKK?s actions are more difficult to analyse.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"It would appear that his initial action was similar to LKF, is that he took a view that the stock could rise to $0.70 when it was trading at $0.685/$0.69."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"He therefore placed a sell order for 300,000 shares at $0.70."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"In order to cover his potential short position, LKF would now have to start 14accumulating at least 300,000 shares in Dayen below the $0.70 level."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"He did this in a short while by buying 100,000 shares at $0.69 and another 200,000 shares at $0.695."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"There then appeared to be a change in strategy when LKK continued to buy more than his sell order and raised his outstanding long position to 551,000 shares in Dayen."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"He then reduced his 300,000 sell order to just 17,000 at $0.70 possibly suggesting that he felt the stock would go higher during the day as this occurred about two hours after the market opened."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,"LKK?s buying (of 500,000 up to close to 900,000) and the withdrawal of his 300,000 sell order were too small relative to the total market turnover that day of 18.44mn shares to influence the stock price movement in either direction."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"It would appear that he took a more bullish intra?day price target for Dayen when he accumulated his total position of 890,000 shares but this was not achieved."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,He therefore closed the day with a net gain of $1710.00.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Reason,,It is my opinion that LKK had adopted a similar trading strategy to LKF at the start but took a more bullish view on the intra?day price target.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Reason,,His buying and selling volumes in themselves were too small to influence other buyers or sellers in the market as to the stock?s price direction.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,It is therefore unlikely that his actions were in breach of Section 97 (1) and 98 (1) of the SIA. 153 July 2002

report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,Observations LKF?s actions on 3° July 2003 were consistent with a proprietary trader taking a view that Star Cruises would have an intra?day volatility of 4?5%.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"He therefore started by building a core long position with the acquisition of 300,000 shares at US$0.415."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"He subsequently put up a sell order for the sale of the 300,000 shares at US$0.43."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,"Because this was done in late afternoon trading and because he had to close or square his position by the end of the trading day, LKF, amended his order about 20 minutes later as the market entered its final hour of trading."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,His amendment moved his sell order from the ask to bid and closed his open position for the day.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,LKF did not exhibit through his trading pattern above any intention to create a false impression that there were either strong buyers or sellers of the stock.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,This is evidenced by his lack of action.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,"His downward amendment of his earlier sell order from $0.43 to US$0.425 for the 200,000 shares probably reflected some time constraint and also that he wanted to close his open position for the day."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,As such his trading actions in Star Cruises did not contravene Section 97 (1) and Section 98 (1) of the SIA.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,LKK?s actions were slightly more confusing.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Number of trades that caused price to move up,His initial actions suggests the same strategy as LKF except that he places a large sell order first about 2?3 bids above the current market bid/ask price.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,He then goes into the market to accumulate shares.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"Over a period of about 17?20 minutes, LKK had accumulated just over 900,000 shares at prices ranging from US$0.42 to US$0.43."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"First there was 400,000 shares at 16US$0.42 and then 300,000 shares at US$O0.425 and finally 205,000 shares at US$0.43."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"After accumulating 700,000 shares at US$0.42 and US$0.425, LKK reduced his sell order of US$0.43 from 800,000 to 300,000."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"He eventually deleted the order altogether just before he made his last buy order for 105,000 shares at US$0.43."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"Unlike LKF, LKK appeared to use his 800,000 sell order to help him accumulate stock below this level."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,His action of lowering his sell volume and removing it altogether seems to confirm this view.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,But the buy and sell volume of LKK relative to the free float were unlikely to have any impact on the stock price as it was less than 20% of the day?s trading volume.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Number of times suspect withdral the buy/sell order and place,But LKK did not try and create the impression of growing buy or sell volumes as he did not remove his orders as they approached the front of the queue and replace them at the end of the same queue.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Profit of the suspects,"Also his action of lowering and eventually removing his sell order of 800,000 could also be due to the fact that the average price of his accumulated block was too high and that he needed a higher exit price to make a small profit."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,"Although LKK?s trading pattern was more confusing and certain parts could be construed as trying to create a false market, the data and evidence are not conclusive."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,Also it does not appear from the stock price movement and his eventual proprietary trading loss that he was able to influence the stock price or the action of other investors.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,"A less clear outcome and given that his trading volume was a relatively small part of the day?s total volume, it is unlikely that LKK had contravened Section 97 (1) and Section 98 (1) of the SIA."

report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"He subsequently bought 50,000 shares at $0.90 to square his trading position."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,LKF?s client transaction is typical of an intra?day contra?trade.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,"The client goes in to 3uy 300,000 NOL shares at a price slightly higher than the previous day?s close $0.88."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"With this long position, the client then gives a sell order to sell the same amount, ie 300,000 shares at $0.90 which is four bids higher."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,The client is taking a view that the stock will at least rise to $0.90 during the rest of the day.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,No other action was taken by LKF or his client until the sell order was matched within the next three to four minutes.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,"LKK?s actions were similar and probably reflect the same view of the trading pattern of the stock, ie that from the current price it could rise to $0.90 during the day."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,This probably suggests that they discussed or communicated this trading strategy to each other.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,"LKK?s initial buy order of 100,000 shares and subsequent sell order of 1,000,000 shares at $0.90 was similar, ie build a long position and then set a short position to close the long position 3?4 bids higher."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,"To complete this transaction, LKK now has to accumulate enough stock to match his closing sell order at below the average price of his sell order."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"He then continued to accumulate about 448,000 shares at prices ranging from $0.875 up to $0.90 but the bulk was at or below $0.895."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"Once LKK realized he could not accumulate enough to match his sell order of 1,000,000 he reduced this order."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,"At the end when his sell position was closed, LKK was still short by 50,000 shares in NOL which he had to buy at $0.90."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"It is possible that LKK could have tried to create an impression of a big seller when he placed his 1,000,000 sell order at $0.90."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"But as his total trading volume of the day was less than 10%, this effect was unlikely."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,We also did not see any signs of buy and sell orders 18being entered and withdrawn just before they reach the front of the queue.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,This type of activity is usually used to create a false impression of growing buying or selling interest.

report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"He buys 300,000 shares at $0.41 and then enters a sell order to clear the position at $0.435 which is five bids higher."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,This process was completed after about 45 minutes.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,No action was taken in between the ?wo transaction by LKK for PAM.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,A typical intra?day contra trade with no significant changing of buy or sell orders to create an impression of growing demand for the stock.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,The slightly bigger proprietary trades of LKK may appear to be creating an impression of growing demand but they are not.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,We have identified three completely separate transactions by LKK.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"LKK first enters a sell order for the stock for 3,000,000 shares at one bid away from the current ask price."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,He then starts collecting as many shares as he can below that sell price.

report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,He then places sell orders at one to two bids higher.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,Again no sign of LKK trying to create any false impression of growing buy or growing sell orders.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,The downward revision in his sell orders was just to match and close his long position.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,Also his total trading for the two transactions was between 1?9% and was in itself too small to influence the stock price in any way.

report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,There are several possible reasons for the removal which include an expectation that the stock would go higher or that he wanted more buyers to ernerge to clear his brother?s sell position.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,The former seems more likely as their total positions in the market that day was less than 16% of the stocks trading volume.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"Ever the removal of the 3,000,000 sell order does not constitute an attempt to create a false market as its volume was too small."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,,,We again did not see any evidence to create the impression of growing buying or selling interest in the stock.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Event,,"So while we are unsure as to why LKK removed his 3,000,000 sell order there is no evidence that both LKF and LKK have breached Section 97 (1) and Section 98 (1) of the SIA."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Reason,,"Having reviewed the eight different stock transactions by LKK, LKF and in some instances PAM for possible breaches of Sections 97 (1) and 98 (1) of the SIA, it is my opinion that it is not possible to conclusively state that a breach or contravention of the above Sections of the SIA have occurred."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Reason,,It is my opinion that both LKK and LKF probably consulted or communicated daily with each other on their respective trading activities for any particular day.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Reason,,"This probably explains why their trading activity revolved around the same stocks Of the two, LKF?s transactions and trading pattern were very typical or a proprietary trader."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Reason,,His actions fell within what was acceptable under the SIA

report08.pdf.sent.csv,Reason,,"LKK, on the other hand adopts a more aggressive trading strategy and while there were instances where it could be deemed that he was trying to create a false market in terms of his buying and selling activity, it is also possible that other factors and considerations could have resulted in the same course of action."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Reason,,"In the case of LKK, there were some instances where it appeared that he could be trying to influence the market perception on the buying or selling interest in a stock."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Reason,,But this trading volumes were relatively low such that it would be difficult to arrive at the conclusion definitively.
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Reason,,"Some of his actions could also be the result of a misreading of a stock?s intra?day direction which could be influenced by external factors such as the trend in the broader market, other markets in Asia or even US index futures."
report08.pdf.sent.csv,Reason,,"It is therefore not possible to conclude that LKK, in the instances where it appeared that he was trying to influence the market, that he had in fact breached Section 97 (1) and Section 98 (1) of the SIA."

report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Whilst systematic trading at the end of the day may not be good practice it is also not forbidden practice.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For instance, given the time zone of Singapore relative to European and US investors, a brokerage specialising in smaller European or American investors, may display a pattern of undertaking many late and last trades simply because orders from such clients are given late in the afternoon."

report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,In no month did the Group account for less than 50% of day?end closes and in the month of April the Group accounted for every single day?end close.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"It is difficult to envisage a situation where such intensity of trading, particularly between 17 March to 2 June 2000 (where the Group accounted for 49 trading day?end closes out of the 53 trading clay?end closes), would not affect investor perception and thus the price and market for Links."

report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There are three major schools of thought with regards market efficiency.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"At one extreme, there are those who do not believe markets are efficient."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For such persons, the intensity and systematic pattern of trading described in para 3.4 would, inevitably, distort the market for Links since such an intense and systematic trading pattern must affect the price for Links."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"At the other extreme, there are those who believe the market are always efficient unless there are structural impediments or blatant manipulation."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For such persons, para 3.4 would be insufficient evidence."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,I belong to the third and largest group which believes that markets are semi?efficient.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This group believes that the level of efficiency, or inefficiency, depends on several factors including investor knowledge of a counter or security."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Singapore is a smallish? market and Links is a smallish counter, thus the level of knowledge by investors is likely to be low."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"A priori, this means that even relatively small trades in Links could distort the price of Links creating a false market in the stock."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"On this basis it would not be unreasonable for expert opinion to conclude on the basis of para 3.2 alone, that a false and misleading price and market for Links must have been created at several times during the Period and for the Period as a whole."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Given the seriousness of allegations, I am of the opinion that a higher level of confidence needs to be obtained prior to reaching a conclusion."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Accordingly, I have set out four tests."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The tests and their purpose are as follows: 3.6.1 3.6.2 Test 1:
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"To test that the bias towards a rise, or a fall, in the price of Links, on those days when the Group made a day?end trade, is about the same as, or at least not significantly dissimilar to, the bias towards a rise, or a fall, in the price of Links, on those days when day?end trades were made by persons unassociated with the Group."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This test exams the day?on?day rises and falls to see if the Group?s actions resulted in a directional bias.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"A directional bias means the Group?s actions lead to a disproportionate number of day?on?day rises or a disproportionate number of day?on?day falls, in the share price of Links; Test 2:"
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"To test that the differential between the closing price of each day and the highest price reached on each day, on those days when the Group made a day?end trade, is about the same, or at least not significantly dissimilar to, the differential between the closing price of each day and the highest price reached on each day, on those days when the day?end trades were made by persons unassociated with the 5 of 21Private & Confidential ACH Investments Pte Ltd 3.7 Group."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"All things being equal, the differentials between the day?end close and the day high should be randomly and normally distributed around the mean/average of the differentials"

report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The day?to?day changes were sorted and classified as a rise, a fall or no change."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The results are shown as table 2.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Of the 71 trading days where the Group accounted for the day?end trade, 14 such days saw the closing price lower, 20 such days saw the closing price unchanged and 37 days saw the closing price higher, than the previous day?s closing price."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Given that there were 30 days where the closing price of Links was lower than its previous closing price, this means that the Group accounted for 47% (14 days out of 30 days) only."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"All things being equal, the Group should only have accounted for 70% (expected norm), since they account for about 70% of total trading days (71 days out of 101 days)."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The results of this test show that there is a significant deviation from norm between those day?end trades that were accounted for by the :Group and those that were accounted for y third parties.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The data strongly suggests that on trading days where the Group accounted for the day? end close, it was far more likely that the closing price would rise instead of fall (the probability of a rise is 2.6 times higher than a fall)}. The data also strongly suggests that on trading days where the Ciroup did not account for the day?end close, it was far more likely that the closing price would fall instead of rise."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The results show that the Group?s actions are highly correlated to the 6 of 21Private & Confidential ACH Investments Pte Ltd direction of the day?on?day closing price changes.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The results suggest that Group?s actions tended to push the share price of Links upwards.

report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The differential between the closing price of Links and its day high were calculated by way of dividing the day high by the day close and subtracting 1 (high/close ?1).
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Thus if the day high is the same as the day close, the differential is 0%."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,If the day high was 10% above the day close the differential will be 10%.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The mean/average of these differentials was calculated and this was about 2.5%.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"To allow for any errors and to create a reasonable category or interval, we allowed the Mean interval to be 2 to 3%."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If the differentials were randomly and reasonably normally distributed around the Mean, we would expect: (a) to see those days where the Group accounted for the day?end trade be about 70% for all three categories; and (b) for the numbers of days in the Below 2% category to be about equal to the number of days in the Above 3% category."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The data in table 3 clearly shows that the differentials are neither randomly nor normally distributed around the Mean.

report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,It would not be an exaggeration to say that on several days the Group was the market.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,One criticism that has been levelled at tests such as those used above is the issue of market consistency.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The liberalization of the Singapore Stock Exchange, which has resulted in the listing of many smaller companies, and weak economic conditions, which have dampened trading volumes on the Exchange, has resulted in low traded volumes in many securities."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The critique of market consistency asks the question of whether or not dealers and traders should be responsible for dealing patterns and actions which may cause distortions in the price, and the market of a security, at this time of low volumes but which may not cause distortions when the market is active."

report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Wong accounted for the vast majority of trading days (60 of the 71) where the Group was responsible for the day?end trade.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As such, when I speak of the Group I am in effect also speaking about Wong."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Accordingly, any conclusions drawn with respect to the Group applies to Wong. Chan! accounted for only 3 of the trading days where the Group was responsible for the day?end trade."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"None of these days were significant or highly significant days such as the opening day or trade, trade day after a significant piece of news etc."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"It is thus unlikely that Chan, individually, created or could have created a false or misleading appearance for the price and/or volume and/or market for Links."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Philip and Wong keyed in and/or executed trades on select days where they bought and sold shares of Links at the same price.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Given that there is a cost to such keying in and there is a potential loss of commission dollars, brokers with buy and sell orders at the same price usually cross or marry such stock off the market."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"However, the keying in of large quantity of a stock to sell when you have a large buy order, and the keying in of a large quantity of stock to buy when you have a large sell order, is a trading tactic that is not uncommon."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,It is a trading tactic used relatively frequently to disguise one?s true intentions.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If used in this manner, the tactic resembles a ?poker bluff ."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Since the long term implication of such tactics tend not to be significant ? one has to execute the actual order eventually ? the tactic is not considered poor practice by the industry.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Thus when examining Philip and Wong?s actions, I excluded trades which were keyed in and not executed on the basis that it is ?hot (air? and unlikely to affect investor perceptions."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Such ?poker bluffs?, however, carry a risk."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In other words, one can end up acquiring shares one did not intend or vice versa."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Such acquisitions or sales, however, appear in the traded volumes and the prices are recorded."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As a result, if sufficiently material, they could affect investor perception."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Table 10, shown on the following page, represents executed buy and sell trades on the game day at the same price."

report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"On 6 days, the combined volume of buys and sells ? that is to say the trades by Philip and Wong ? exceeded 20% of those day?s total volume and thus were of note."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,4 of these days saw such trades account for more than 35% of those days? total volume.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,35% is considered the point beyond which a buyer or seller begins to have a very significant influence on the price of a security.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The pattem of buy volumes as compared to the sell volumes and vice versa is very large.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Normally if one is a natural seller, one tries to buy as little as possible during the ?poker bluff and vice versa. 15 of 21Pr vate & Confidential ACH Investments Pte Ltd 4."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,3 If we assumed all the trades were ?poker bluffs? then the smaller of the trades ? the buy or the sell volume ? would then be on the ?bluff side . of the trade.
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Under such an assumption, it is not the combined volume which is important but the ?bluff side since it does not represent real ? demand or supply."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Even under such an extreme assumption, on two days the ?bluff trades accounted for more than 20% of those day?s traded volume."

report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Whilst day?end trading is practiced by certain niche segments of the industry, and is not considered illegal practice, the industry has an over ridding principle that professionals in the industry shall not undertake any actions which are likely to distort prices or cause investors to be misled."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"I am of the opinion that the way the Group and/or Philip individually and/or Wong individually, executed their day?end trades breached these principles."
report09.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Given my analysis, test results and conclusions laid out in Section 3 and in particular para 3.17, I am of the considered opinion that Wong and Philip, in executing buy?sell trades in Links shares at the same price within a trading day, created or caused to be created or was calculated to create: 4.6.1 A false or misleading appearance of active trading in Link shares; and thus 4.6.2 A false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for Links shares."

report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,I have also been asked to include any other issue which I discover in the course of my review that I believe may be relevant to my opinion and/or the case.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"There are, basically, two broad categories of share market investors or participants."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,They are the short-term traders and the mid- to long-term investors.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,The short-term traders look for short-term price changes to make his money.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"The duration between his ?buy? and ?sell? trades can be as short as minutes or hours within the same day, or it can extend to the next day, or even a few days later."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Examples of short-term traders are (securities?) house dealers, intra-day traders (day-traders), share speculators, short-term investors, hedge funds, etc."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"The mid- to long-term investor, on the other hand, does more research on what shares to buy and relies on the appreciation in share prices over the medium to long term to make his profits."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Hence, such an investor pays more attention on the fundamentals of a company, i.e., its financial strength, profit performance, future profit potential, growth prospects, and its historical and current price levels, before deciding to invest."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"His investment time horizon is naturally longer, which can be months or even years."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Some example of mid/long-term investors are unit trusts, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies, etc."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"All investors, however, buy and sell shares with profits in mind."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,They will try to maximize profits by buying low and selling high.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Thus, they watch the movements of share prices closely."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"In fact, the short-term investors, especially, the day- and contra- traders and speculators not only watch daily share prices closely, they also pay attention to the prevailing market sentiment as reflected by the movements in the share price and volume of trades done."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"They are constantly monitoring the price trends of shares during the trade day and will look out, particularly, for ?bullish? and ?bearish? indicators from trades done on the market, especially, the last done price."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,A share is traded on SGX based on its daily price quotations as represented by the best ?ask? and ?bid? prices.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"If a share is actively traded, the spread between the best ?ask? and best ?bid? is usually 1 ?tick? (or 1 ?bid?)."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"This is also the smallest amount the share price can change, according to SGX rules."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"For example, a share that is trading below $1/-, this ?tick? would be $0.005 (or, in other words, the share price is quoted at half-cent intervals)."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Thus, the prevailing ?market? for a share can be shown as, say, $0.12/$0.115, where $0.12 represents the best ?ask? and $0.115 the best ?bid?."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"By observing how a share is traded and the last done price, investors can, generally, get a feel of the prevailing market sentiment of a share."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"For example, all things being equal, if a share was traded at the ?ask? price, it is viewed as more ?bullish?, whereas if it was done at the ?bid? price, it would be viewed as more ?bearish?."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,This is no different from someone looking for an indication of the trend in the property market.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"If a piece of property is transacted at the seller?s price (?ask?), it means that the buyer is more keen to buy the property and hence is willing to pay what the seller asks for."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,This would likely be interpreted more as a ?bullish? factor.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"On the other hand, if the seller is eager to dispose of the property and willing to sell to the buyer at the latter?s price (?bid?), then this would be considered more ?bearish?."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"During the course of a trading day, there will always be this interplay of ?bullish? and ?bearish? signals which will affect market sentiment and hence trading of the shares."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Thus, when a trader/investor sees a share done at the ?ask? price, he is likely to interpret it as something more ?bullish? and likewise, if is done at ?bid?, then it would likely be considered more ?bearish?."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"These ?bullish? and ?bearish? factors can have an influence on a share trader?s sentiment and, therefore, his decision to buy or sell shares."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"All things being equal, a ?bullish? sentiment would tend to draw in buyers whereas a ?bearish? one would tend to encourage selling of a particular share or a more cautious buying stance."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,It is useful to bear in mind the explanation above as it would help in the understanding of Ong?s trades and their effect on market and price of the Specified Shares.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"All the 4 Specified Shares traded at $0.115 and below and, as such, are generally referred to as ?penny? stocks, which are shares priced substantially below a dollar."

report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"The manner and circumstances in which Ong carried out these trades, the likely reasons why they were done and their impact, if any, on the market for and price of the Specified Shares were examined in detail."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"From the analysis, it appeared that Ong?s main trading strategy in respect of the 4 Specified Shares was to make money by selling shares at the prevailing ?ask? price and buying at the prevailing ?bid? price thus profiting from the price difference (or spread)."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,Profit of the suspects,"For these penny stocks, the spread of $0.005 in these cases was sufficient for Ong to make a profit after netting off his trading costs."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,This is a legitimate trading strategy and there is nothing wrong trading in this manner.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"What Ong did, however, was more than this."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"All the evidence appeared to show that Ong had, in addition to his other legitimate trades, carried out these 28 trades in a very deliberate and contrived manner, and with no genuine commercial basis."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,They appeared to have been carried out for the sole purpose of luring in investors and ensuring that his main trading strategy of selling at the ?ask? price and buying at ?bid? price was effective.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,(This will be discussed in detail in a later section).
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of times suspects' wash trade caused price to increase,"Firstly, all these 28 were ?washed? trades, which meant Ong had carried these out with himself as the counter-party, with no change in beneficial ownership."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"Secondly, almost all the trades (except for one) were done in very small quantities and at a price always higher than the prevailing market."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"For example, Ong?s purchases, of mostly 1 lot each, were done repeatedly at the higher ?ask? price, when others were doing at the lower ?bid? price."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"Next, when these purchases were been being made, Ong was at the same time selling the same shares at larger quantities at the same ?ask? price, namely, executing his main strategy."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"Furthermore, these trades were timed and carried out, in all cases, soon after the last done price had fallen to the lower ?bid? level."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Thus, the The manner and frequency in which these trades were repeatedly done appeared to show that Ong had intended traded to raise the share price each time it fell to the lower level and to give the appearance that there was always demand at the higher ?ask? price."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"To achieve maximum effect, Ong appeared to have intentionally split these purchases into small lots (mostly of 1 lot each) and spread these trades over the course of the day."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,Profit of the suspects,"It appeared that Ong was doing this for the sole purpose of supporting his other more profitable trades which involved selling larger volumes of the Specified Shares at the higher ?ask? price and buying at the lower ?bid? price, taking advantage of the price difference of $0.005."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,to create a ?bullish? sentiment and draw in investors to buy at the ?ask? price of these shares.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,The end result seemed to be of keeping the prices of the Specified Counters hovering at the prevailing ?ask? and ?bid? levels throughout the day.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Ong would have known that this would give him the best outcome for his trading strategy, allowing him to sell at the ?ask? price and buy at the ?bid price and thus profit from the price spread alone."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"With the prices staying at these levels all the time during the day, Ong would then have no price risks."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,The full details of these will be discussed in this Report.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Ong had traded in the same identical manner with respect to all the 4 Specified Counters and, hence, my opinions expressed below applied equally for IPCO as well as Goldtron, Anwell and Centillion."

report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"it is my opinion that if If not for Ong?s 28 trades, the market for and price of these Specified Shares on those 5 days would not, in all probability, have behaved in the manner it did."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,Ong?s 28 trades had created or were likely to create the false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for and price of the Specified Shares.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"and because these trades appeared to have been carried out deliberately by Ong and without any commercial basis, I am of the opinion that the appearance so created is false or misleading."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"In fact, Ong had traded a total of 31 such trades in the above manner, 28 of which were identified in the Terms of Reference."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"As opposed to the 28 trades which Ong had purchased from himself as the counter-party, the other 3 trades were done with third-parties."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,These 3 trades involved only the shares of Goldtron and Anwell.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"On 29 December 06, Ong Beng Hock (?Ong?) placed an order to buy 800 lots of IPCO shares at $0.075 as soon as the SGX system opened to allow for input of orders at 08:30:00."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,Ong?s ?buy? order was 4th on would be expected to be near the front of the queue.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"Immediately after that, also around 08:30:00, Ong entered another two trades, but this time to sell 1,250 lots of IPCO shares at $0.085 and another to sell 1,300 lots also at $0.085, although the latter order to sell 1,300 lots was later withdrawn at 08:31:49. 44."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs shares traded by the rest of the market during normal market hour,"From the evidence, Ong appeared to be a short-term trader, so these orders seemed normal as he would be expecting to buy at $0.075 and sell at $0.085, netting a gain of $0.01 from the price difference."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,The market opened with trades done at $0.08 and continued to trade at this price for a while.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"At 09:18:17, Ong placed an order to buy 300 lots at $0.08 for which he got 46 lots, with the balance of 254 lots on queue."

report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,Profit of the suspects,"Again, Ong?s purchase at $0.08 appeared normal as at this price he could still make a profit if he was able to sell at $0.085, although this time his net gain would have been reduced to $0.005."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,Profit of the suspects,"At this price difference, Ong could still make a profit after deducting his brokerage (of between 0.18% and 0.5%, depending on which broking house he used), clearing and other fees."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"In fact, this was really Ong?s main trading strategy."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"There was nothing wrong with this, except that Ong went further than this by executing several ?washed? trades."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"As it turned out, at 09:27:09, a third-party bought 100 lots from Ong at $0.085 (from his ?sell? order of 1,250 lots placed earlier)."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,This was the first trade at the ?ask? price of $0.085 on this day.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"A few minutes later, at 09:29:40, another third-party bought 1 lot from Ong another trade was done at $0.085."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"At 09:47:27, however, a third-party sold 80 lots of IPCO shares at the ?bid? price of $0.08 to Ong."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"A few minutes later, at 09:56:20, Ong would key in an order to buy 5 lots at the ?ask? price of $0.085, which was filled immediately."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"The seller was none other than Ong, himself."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Firstly, Ong had sold at this price and still had a ?sell? order yet to be fully filled, so why would he it would be very strange for him to be buying at this same price also? ."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"Secondly, Ong must have known that he would be buying from himself since he had just sold 101 lots at this price just a few minutes earlier and that the ?balance? of his ?sell? order (of 1149 lots) was still at the front of the queue."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of times suspects' wash trade caused price to increase,These 5 lots traded constituted a ?washed? trade as there was no change in the beneficial ownership.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"In fact, at this time, not only was Ong?s balance of the ?sell? order at the front of the queue, the balance of 149 lots of his ?buy? order was also right in front."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"Twelve minutes later, at 10:08:18, a seller sold 120 lots to Ong at the ?bid? price of $0.08."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"Less than one minute later, at 10:09:15, Ong bought 1 lot from himself at ?ask? price of $0.085, bringing the last done price back to $0.085."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,This was similarly unusual because Ong would again have known that he would be buying from himself a second time.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"Furthermore, the purchase of just 1 lot by Ong appeared strange for a penny stock priced at only $0.085."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"At the volume Ong was trading, this 1 lot would not make a significant difference to the amount of shares he was accumulating or his average price, other than just serving the purpose of raising the last done price from $0.08 to $0.085."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Finally, why would Ong would have known that he would be buying and this additional 1 lot of IPCO at a price he had just sold and was still selling? from himself."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,There was no trade done for the next 10 minutes or so.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"At 10:19:05, Ong placed an order to buy 154 lots at the ?ask? price of $0.085, which was immediately filled."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"The seller of these 154 lots again was none other than Ong, himself."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Again, this purchase seemed rather unusual since Ong was still selling at this price and would have known that he would be buying from himself."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"If, suppose Ong had changed his view of the market and felt the market would trend upwards, then a purchase like this would make sense."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"But if that were the case, the logical step would have been for Ong to withdraw his balance of ?sell? order first before actually buying."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Ong would then have, firstly, avoided risking having to buy from himself and secondly, allowed him to re-enter another order to sell at a higher price, if he was indeed of the view that the price would move up."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Also, if Ong had thought that the price would move up and was trying to reduce his short position, buying from himself did not achieve that effect as the ?buy? and ?sell? trades cancelled each other out."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"As it turned out, Ong had left the balance of his ?sell? order at $0.085 and allowed the trades to be done with himself as both buyer and seller."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,This purchase by Ong at his own ?ask? price raised the last done price to $0.085.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"A short while later, at 10:21:12, a third-party then sold 50 lots of IPCO shares at the ?bid? price of $0.08, of which 29 lots were done with Ong."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,This trade reduced the last done price back to $0.08.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"At 10:22:03, less than a minute later, Ong bought 1 lot again at the ?ask? price of $0.085 from himself, raising the last done price back up to $0.085."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,Ong?s trading now appeared to follow a certain pattern.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,He appeared always to be buying 1 lot at the ?ask? price of $0.085 each time to raise the last done price up each time a trade was done at the lower ?bid? price.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,It would appear that he was intentionally creating the impression of some demand at the higher ?ask? price probably hoping to attract some follow-up buying by others at that price also (for which he was first on the ?sell? queue at that price).
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"Ong continued to trade in this manner two more times in the course of the day, at 10:38:58 and 14:07:53."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"Ong?s purchase, at 10:38:58, of 1 lot at $0.085 from himself was done six minutes after the last done price was brought down to $0.08 by a trade of 100 lots at the ?bid? price of $0.08 by third-parties."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,This trade would raise the last done price back to $0.08.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"Ong?s next purchase of 1 lot at the ?ask? price of $0.085 was right after the lunch break at 14:07:53, several minutes after 30 lots were done at $0.08 just as the market re-opened."

report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"It can be seen that, for the whole of 29 December 06, there were only a total of 8 trades done at $0.085."

report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Ong must have found that trading such small amounts each time was effective enough to serve his purpose as he had continued to operate in the same manner with the shares of Goldtron, Anwell and Centillion, after IPCO."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"All the evidence considered, it is my opinion that, All all of Ong?s 28 trades done deliberately at the ?ask? price had the effect of helping to raise, or at least maintain, raising the share price of these 4 Specified Shares on all these occasions duringthe trading session on those 5 days."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,It is also my opinion that because such purchases at the ?ask? price would tend to be interpreted as a more ?bullish? signal by investors and therefore would tend to either ?encourage? buying or ?discourage? selling it would likely have the effect of maintaining or stabilising the price of the Specified Shares.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"As explained above, Ong?s actions in respect of these 28 trades appeared deliberate and contrived and not carried out on a commercial basis."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"They had, in fact, caused the share prices of these 4 Specified Counters to move up and down between the ?ask? and ?bid? levels many more times than would have been the case during those days,"
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"On the contrary, they In my opinion, they had created or likely to have created the false or misleading appeared to have been done with the intention of creating an appearance of an active trading in the market for and price of the Specified Shares during those 5 days."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Ong had, thus, caused fluctuations in the market price of the Specified Shares during those 5 days."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The manner in which Ong carried out these 28 trades also had the effect of raising or inflating the price of these Specified Sharesand in the process caused more fluctuations in the price of those shares.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Finally, it would appear that if not for Ong?s 28 trades, the market action and price behaviour of the 4 Specified Counters, would not have behaved the way it did on those 5 days."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Thus, it is my opinion that Ong?s 28 trades had created or likely to have created a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for and price of the shares of the 4 Specified Counters during those 5 days."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In the light of all the evidence, it is my opinion that Ong, when carrying out the 28 trades on those 5 days, had created or likely to have created an appearance of active trading and also the market for and price of the 4 Specified Shares."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Since these trades appeared to be contrived and not genuine commercial trades, it is my opinion that the appearance so created or likely to have been created is false or misleading."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,These 28 trades also had the effect of raising or inflating the price of these Specified Shares and in the process had caused more fluctuations in the share price of all the 4 Specified Shares during those 5 days.
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In the course of the review, Ong was found to have carried out a total of 31 trades instead of the 28 trades specified in the Terms of Reference."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Presumably, this was because the Terms of Reference included only those 28 trades Ong had carried out with himself as the counter-party."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"From the evidence, there appeared to be an additional 2 trades done in respect of Goldtron shares and 1 trade of Anwell shares which were used by Ong as part of his operations."
report10.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"These were also trades of 1 lot each carried out at the ?ask? prices of Goldtron and Anwell, respectively, to serve his purposes, the only difference being these were bought from third-parties, instead of from Ong himself."

report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,A. Important Point needs to Note about Share Trading Data Bloomberg is a common source of share data; it has its own method of treating share data.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The share prices trading record of Company X on 10 September 2004 shown on Bloomberg in 2008 were different from the Annex document provided by CAD.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"According to Annex record on 10 September 2004, the intra-day high was SGD $ 1.89 while the Bloomberg table shown day high was SGD $1.8067."
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"On the other hand, the share price record on Reuters and Yahoo Finance web site database, are showing same set of data as CAD annex."
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,I suspect the increasing number of shares outstanding and the way Bloomberg treated historical data caused the difference.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"According to Bloomberg, the average numbers of shares outstanding for EPS calculation were 710.1 m at Dec 2004, 713.5 m at Dec 2005, 717.6 m at Dec 2006 and 719.7 m at Dec 2007."

report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The pair could ensure the execution prices were under their control.

report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,False or Misleading Appearances Created or were likely created by the Orders and Transactions of Person A & B with respect to the market for COMPANY X shares
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Their concentrated buying (refer to B.1.1 & 2) will create false appearances or illusion that Share X was in high demand.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The consecutive big buying by Person A and B were suggesting the share price was likely to go up.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The concentrated buying and selling will temporarily increase the stock liquidity and appeared less liquidity risk for Share X.

report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Appearances Created or were likely created by the Orders and Transactions of Person A &B with respect to the price of COMPANY X shares Their concentrated buying within a relative short period of time will create appearances that the share was well bided and at higher price will have support.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The concentrated buying will boost up the buying volume and will give an impression that big investor may have interest in the stock and they will pay a 9 higher price.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,I regard these transactions were intended to create false appearances aiming at manipulating the share price of X for profitable contra-trade.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,False or misleading appearances Created or were likely created by the Orders and Transactions of Person A &B with respect to the price of COMPANY X shares
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,In reality there were no dominant news leading to favor buying or selling of the stocks.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"The pair?s trading activities produced an illusion that the share was undervalued and also lot of interests to buy the stock around the trading price, so there were upside to the share price."
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The pair was practicing share price manipulation.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,They practiced similar manipulating trading pattern for short-term profit.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The incident happened in a normal trading day without significant internal or external factors that could potentially affect the general share market or the company?s share prices.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The orders and trades of Person A & B made the appearance that shares of Company X were in high demand.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The designing trading pattern adopted by the pair strongly suggested the orders and trades of Person A & B were executed according to a well conceived plan.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The pre-conceived trading plan (made up 61% of the day?s turnover) will likely push up the share price and let Person A has a high chance to reap quick day profit.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,This plan should be considered as share price manipulation plot.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Normal Market condition No major global stock market movement worth noting around 10 Sep 2004.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"No major corporate events announced shortly before and after 10 Sep 2004 that caused large volatilities to share price 10 When the above three conditions were fulfilled, the stock market condition will be considered normal."
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The pair will ensure their total trading power (volume) will be larger than 50% or significant enough to have influence on the share price and market mood for the share.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Person A bought the shares earlier than Person B and when Person A bought 96.5% of the total trade shares ((386,000/400,000) %) on the day, then Person B engaged in buying the share."
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Creating the phenomenon of sustained buying or shorting mood for the share and the buying or shorting power from Person B was more than 100% bigger (in terms of number of shares) than Person A. C.2.1.4
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The crossing transaction could ensure Person A?s position exited clear and the crossed prices were controlled by both parties.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Person A made profit by selling mainly to Person B through the open market.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In this case, 100% crossed to Person B and 63% of the trade out shares were sold at intra-day high price"
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The following facts and sequence of trades lead to my conclusion: C.2.2.1
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The total number of shares the pair bought was 1.21 millions of shares on 10 September 2004.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,It was 61% of the total turnover of the day and was also significant when compared with the last 5 trading day?s day trade volume.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,It still amounted to at least 47% of the day?s turnover or 6.15 times of the day?s turnover.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,It means the pair has enough buying power in a normal trading day 11 to influence the share price.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Furthermore, the pair executed the trades within a relatively short time frame ? concentrated buying with explosive volume."
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,It took Person A less than 45 minutes to finish his trading.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,It takes Person B 1 hour and 23 minutes to finish their trades.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Person A finished his buying and Person B kept buying the shares until all the shares owned by Person A were taken up by Person B.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,It seems to make sure the buying power was lasting long enough for the sell orders to complete.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Person A bought 96.5% of the shares he wanted to day trade before Person B entered any trade.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Strongly indicating probability of subsidizing Person A. C.2.2.4 All 100% of the shares
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,A?s average cost was $1.8513 vs. Selling price $1.8863.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,While Person B?s average cost was $1.87979.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Person A made profit under such arrangement.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,I consider this planned arrangement aiming to manipulate the share price in favor for Person A to make a quick profit.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The pair?s trading practice in the last three incidents was using the same trading strategy.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,1 The buying or selling power of the pair should capable of suppressing or pushing up share price during their trading exercises.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Their total trading volume accounted for 50%, 61% and 90% of that day?s turnover."
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,And their total trading volume accounted for 27 times to 50% of previous 5 trading days? turnovers.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,See Table D. 2 Person A?s accumulation trading activity should near 96% completion before Person B came in to move the market price.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This plan seemed to make sure Person
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,A?s built-up position was in the best position for trading profit.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Person A?s portfolio costs were always lower than Person B and in the last 3 incidents, Person A all made profits."
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"With 98% of Person A?s positions were sold or bought from Person B, it seems these trades were to make sure the pair could control the speed and the price execution."
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,See Table E. 4 For Person B directly involved in the trading of the shares in the last 3 incidents should be considered out-law for a large investment management organization.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The by-pass of Central Dealing desk should have decent reasons and proper documentation to justify the action of the fund manager.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The consecutive 3 out of normal trading incidents strongly indicated the planned nature of the trading plot.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The probability that all the 3 incidents are happened by chance is extremely low.
report11.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Just considered for a Fund Manager to by-pass Central Dealing desk three times in less than 7 months and have the activities and consequences followed as described in the previous 4 points, it is very likely that these were planned exercises."

report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,When a decision is made to buy a particular counter he will make his purchase according to market conditions.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If his purchase quantity is significant, he will buy rationally and will usually accumulate his shares over a reasonable period of time, so as not to push up the share price in the process."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,His aim is to get in at the best possible price for the quantity he wants to invest.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In addition to price, liquidity of the counter is also important to him."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For trades that are bigger, he needs sufficient liquidity to buy his quantity at a reasonable price and to exit easily when he sells."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,A counter is considered liquid when a sizable volume of that share can be traded each time without significantly affecting the price.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,One common characteristic of a liquid counter is a narrow spread of usually one ?tick? or ?bid {explained at Para 3.12 below) between the ?ask? and ?bid? prices.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Generally, the ?blue chips? and shares of bigger companies are more liquid as they attract a larger group of investors and are traded more often and in bigger volumes each day."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This is not the case for many of the smaller companies whose shares are thinly traded and, more often than not, have only a small group of following investors."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Thus an illiquid or thinly traded counter is usually difficult to buy in, for sizeable quantity, and hard to get out without the price being adversely affected."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"At times, the market spread between the ?ask? and ?bid? prices of an illiquid share can be significant (i.e. several ?bids away)."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,A counter is traded on SGX based on its daily market price quotations as represented by the best ?ask? and ?bid? prices (also commonly referred to as the ?market).
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If a counter is actively traded (liquid), the ?market? for this counter will always have a narrow spread (?market spread?) of usually 1 ?bid ? i.e. the best ?ask and ?bid> prices will differ only by 1 ?bid?, which is the minimum amount the share3.13."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"According to SGX rules applicable during the Relevant Period, for a counter trading above $1/?, this 1 ?bid? is $0.01 and for those trading below $1/?, it is $0.005."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Thus, the market for a share can be shown as, say, $1.12/$1.11(ask/bid) or $0.85/$0.845, if it is below $1/?. If, on the other hand, the market spread of a particular counter is usually more than a few ?bids?, e.g. $0.82/$0.79, then it is likely that this counter is illiquid."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"By observing how a counter is traded and the last done price, investors can, generally, get a feel of the prevailing market sentiment of a share."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"For example, all things being equal, and irrespective of the overall trend, if a share is traded at the ?ask? price, it is a ?bullish? signal, whereas if it is done at the ?bid> price, it is considered ?bearish."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This is no different from someone looking for an indication of, say, the latest sentiment in the property market."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If a piece of property is transacted at the seller?s price (?ask?), it means that the buyer is more keen to buy the property and pay what the seller asks for."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"On the other hand, if the seller is eager to dispose of the property and willing to sell to the buyer at the latter?s price (*?bid?), then this is a ?bearish? signal."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In the course of a trading day, there will always be this interplay of ?bullish? and ?bearish? signals which will affect the prevailing market sentiment and the trading behaviour of investors."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"A ?bullish sentiment would tend to attract buyers into the market or discourage selling, whereas a ?bearish? one would tend to force out sellers or discourage buying. Investor Protection"
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Ensuring a fair and orderly market and investor protection are some of the top priorities of SGX.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Apart from making sure that listed companies comply with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to listed companies, SGX has, over the years, implemented various measures to protect the interests of the investing public."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In the past, the market opens at 0900 hrs and closes at 1700 hrs sharp."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In this system, the first opening trade and the last closing trade determined the opening 73.19. 3.20. and closing prices, respectively, regardless of the quantity traded."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"These prices, therefore, may or may not be representative of the actual demand and supply at opening and closing."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The system was changed to one where, before the market opens each day, orders to sell (?ask?) and buy (?bid?) are keyed in on to a queue during the pre?opening routine which will then be matched by an algorithm to determine the opening price at 0900 hrs, a process very similar to the bidding of the Certificate of Entitlement."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The ?matched? price becomes the opening price for that share.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Similarly, after 5 pm each day, all ?ask? and ?buy? orders are placed on a queue during the pre?close routine and matched."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The price matched at 1705 hrs will be the closing price.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This change was believed to have been introduced to ensure that the opening and closing prices were more representative of the actual supply and demand of the shares at those times.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,A below is extracted from SGX?s website showing one of the many examples on how the matched price during the pre?close routine is computed.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Example of how prices are matched on SGX during pre?close routine3.21.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In this example, the sell pressure changes to buy pressure at $10.50 and $10.60 and since the same number of trades (18 lots) can be executed at both these prices, the final computed price will be the price that is closer to the last traded price."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If, say, the last traded price was $10.40, then the computed price will be $10.50."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The closing price of a counter, in particular, is a key piece of financial information."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,It is widely used in charts and technical analysis.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Share analysts derive ratios and averages from these closing prices and use them extensively in their investment research.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Fund managers typically use the closing prices at the end of a month, the end of a quarter and the end of a year for periodic valuation of the funds they manage."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"How a fund performs over a month, a quarter or a year, thus, depends on the closing prices of the shares in the portfolio."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In turn, this determines the performance of the fund manager and the fees and incentives he collects."

report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"It was possible, therefore, based on these listings to re?construct how Nuni used MAOF, Mart and his own personal account to trade in Sincere and RSH shares during the Relevant Period."

report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,They became more active during the Relevant Period on days when Nuni traded.

report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Most of the trades were done through the accounts of MAOF and Mart, although he also used his personal account in the case of Sincere shares."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The findings in respect of Sincere shares during the Relevant Period are as follows: (i) Nuni?s trades had artificially raised the closing price of Sincere shares during seven distinct periods; (ii)
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Nuni had carried out various ""washed"" trades between Group members in furtherance of (i) above."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There were seven periods when Nuni traded to artificially raise the closing price of Sincere shares.

report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Their trades had created a false or misleading appearance with respect to the price of Sincere shares.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Nuni Traded RSH shares were thinly traded during the period prior to Nuni?s trading.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"For example, in the 11 months from 15 February 2006 to 8 January 2007, there were only 57 days where there were trades done."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,About a quarter of the 57 days had daily trades of 10 lots or less.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"For the remaining 43 days, only six days had daily trade volumes exceeding 500 lots."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In terms of price, RSH shares also did not move much within the day and from day to day."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The intra?day price only fluctuated within a narrow range most of the time.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,There were only 8 days where the difference between the day?s high and the day?s low exceeded $0.040 (with the biggest difference being $0.100 on one occasion).
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Similarly, the day?s closing prices also experienced little change from day to day."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Over this same 11? month period, there were only six occasions where the change was more than $0.030."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Only once was the increase at $0.130 and even then the volume traded on that day was only 100 lots.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"When Nuni Started Trading When Nuni started trading RSH shares using the accounts of MAOF and Mart from 9 January 2007, the price of RSH shares experienced more fluctuations, with the intra?day price change frequently exceeding $0.050."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"On one occasion, the intra?day price change marked a high of $0.200."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The daily traded volume of RSH shares for the months of January 2007 and February 2007 also increased significantly.

report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The Group?s trades are marked in red whereas those by ?Others? are marked in blue.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Similar to the case of Sincere, it was noted that Nuni appeared to be trading to artificially raise the closing price of RSH shares during the two periods as elaborated 45Appendix B below."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In so doing, Nuni was also found to have conducted cross (?washed?) trades on four instances during the two periods."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The observations and findings are detailed below: 1.7.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,# Group?s Vol ? mOthers & Closing Price Chart 10; Daily Price and Volume of RSH Shares in December 2006 and January 2007 before and after the Group?s Trades There were two periods in the Relevant Period when Nuni traded deliberately to raise the share price of RSH.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"These were: = ? 31 January 2007, and a _ 27?28 February 2007."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Nuni used both MAOF and Mart to actively buy RSH shares in January and February 2007.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"During the above periods, MAOF and Mart had timed the bulk of their purchases to occur during the last half?hour of trading and/or during the pre?close routine."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In this way, they were able to both trade the price of RSH shares higher and also ensure they set a higher closing price by executing the last trade."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"On 31 January 2007 and 27 & 28 February 2007, this task was easy because they were the only buyers of RSH shares during these three days, and their trades made up 100% of the respective day?s total trading volume."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Table E above shows the trades done by the Group, the resulting closing price and the net price change over the previous day?s close."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The table also listed the last traded price by ?Others? (and what the closing price might have been if the Group?s last trades were taken out). Nuni?s Modus Operandi C 31 Janua 2007 1.11. 1.12.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"On 31 January 2007, the market opened quietly with no trades right up till 16:45:00 hrs."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"At 16:46:05 hrs, MAOF bought 35 lots at $0.910 when the prevailing market price was at $0.910/$0.850 (a spread of 12 ?bids?)."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,This was followed by Mart?s purchase order at 16:51:14 hrs when it bought 50 lots at $0.920.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"At 16:52:04 hrs, Mart placed an order to sell at $0.990 for 5 lots when there was no seller at all in the market."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"At 16:58:16 hrs, less than 2 minutes before the market closed, MAOF bought these 5 lots at $0.99 (?Washed? Trade 1)."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"This being the last trade, set the closing price of the day at $0.990."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,This was an increase of $0.080 over the previous day?s closing price of $0.910.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Thus MAOF and Mart were able to raise the RSH share price from $0.920 (the last traded price) to $0.990 with just 5 lots of ?washed? trades.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"This was possible because they were the only buyers in the market on this day, contributing 100% of the buying."

report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,There was no more trade conducted in RSH shares until the pre?close routine when MAOF bought 40 lots at $1.00.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,This was the last trade in RSH shares and 481.16.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Appendix B accordingly set the day?s closing price.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,This was an increase of $0.05 over the previous day?s closing price of $0.950.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"As there were no other buyers, all the 42 lots done during the day were by the Group."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"On 28 February 2007, the market for RSH shares also opened without any trades for the whole morning and even later into the afternoon."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"As at 15:36:17 hrs, the last traded price of RSH shares was $1.00 (being the previous day?s traded price)."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"The prevailing best ?ask? price was also $1.00, while the next best ?ask? price was $1.03."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,There were no sellers above the price of $1.03.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Accordingly, the highest price that can be transacted based on the existing market conditions is only $1.03."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Nuni started by placing ?sell orders for 10 and 190 lots of RSH shares at the price of $1.11 and $1.20 respectively using Mart?s account.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The sale orders were 11 and 20 ?bids? higher that the prevailing best ?ask price.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"At 16:53:15 hrs, MAOF started buying 10 lots at $1.00 and followed up to buy another 96 lots at $1.00 at 16:59:13 hrs."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Then in quick succession over the next 28 seconds, MAOF picked up a further 94 lots at progressively higher prices from $1.03 to $1.20."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In the course of the purchases, MAOF acquired 90 lots from Mart (i.e. 10 lots at $1.10 and 80 lots at $1.20) (?Washed"
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"During the pre?close routine, MAOF placed an order to buy 800 lots at $1.20."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,This order was matched with the remaining sale order of 110 lots at $1.20 in MART?s account (?Washed Trade 4).
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,MAOF was the only buyer for RSH shares on this day.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,It had bought a total of 310 lots which accounted for 100% of the trades done for the day.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Out of these 310 lots, 200 lots or 64.5% were done with Mart as the counter?party."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,90 lots were traded less than 1 minute before 17:00:00 hrs and the remaining 110 lots were done during the pre?close routine.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"The price of RSH shares closed at $1.20, which was $0.20 higher than the previous day?s closing price."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Chart 12 below shows the trades on 28 February 2007 at half?hourly intervals and during the pre?close routine.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,All the trades were done by the Group.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"As in the case of Sincere, Nuni had used the accounts of MAOF and Mart to deliberately carry out trades during the two periods to raise the closing price of RSH shares."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,MAOF and Mart had concentrated their buying near the end of the trading day and/or during the pre?close routine.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In fact, they were the only buyers on the three days, accounting for 100% of the day?s total trading volume."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"As RSH was thinly?traded, they were able to push up the price of RSH shares significantly higher by buying the shares at progressively higher prices late in the day."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"On all three days, they were responsible for the last trade and accordingly, set the closing price."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"During these two periods, Nuni also used ?washed? trades to raise the share price of RSH."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,RSH was relatively illiquid during the two periods and there is usually a lack of sell orders at high prices.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"As a result, it was difficult for the shares of RSH to rise above a certain level."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Accordingly, Nuni used one of the accounts to enter a sale 501.24."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,1.25. Appendix B order at several bids higher than the prevailing traded price.
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Thereafter, Nuni then used remaining accounts to purchase RSH shares up to the price he set earlier for his sale order, resulting in ?washed trades between the accounts."
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"In this way, Nuni was able to register a higher transacted price for RSH"
report12.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"On 31 January 2007, the Group raised the closing price of RSH shares by $0.080 (from $0.910 to $0.990) or by 8.8%."

report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,To provide details of how this had happened and the extent to which this had happened.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"On the assumption that Yip controlled the trading of the 9 accounts belonging to the above mentioned 4 persons, ie that the trades, though transacted through various accounts was effectively the work of one person:"
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In my opinion, the collection of data suggests that the trades, taken together, did create a false or misleading appearance of active trading in Novena over the prescribed time period."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Basis Several factors for deciding whether a false or misleading appearance of active trading were considered: The presence of matched trades; The significant volume and value of these matched trades; The frequency of these matched trades: The lengthy duration through which a combination of these factors was olbserved.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The Presence of Matched Trades: £ @
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,For every stock transaction there is a purchase and a sale.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,A matched trade here rafers to a situation where the purchase and the sale of a counter in a transaction are made by the same controlling entity.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The effect of such an action is that market volume is created, but with no effective change in control."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The additional volume arising from matched trades is thus ""artificial"", giving an impression that there is greater demand/supply of the stock than is actually the case."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Thus it contributes towards creating a false and misleading appearance of active trading.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Over the period 3 June 2002 to 9 September 2003, the presence of matched trades between the accounts of Tay Teck Boon, Teo Luck Hong, Chan Kin Kay and Chow Hoong Wei, was noted on 112 days."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,How do we assess the significance of matched trades?
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In considering whether a false or misleading appearance of active trading was created, the significance of matched trades must be considered in relation to the transactional liquidity of the stock itself, in this case, Novena."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Transactional liquidity is expressed in terms of dollar?value (in short, value), which is the volume (number of shares) multiplied by price of a transaction."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The average value of the Suspect?s matched trades per day, on those days in which matched trades were observed, was $39,022."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The average purchase size of Novena per market participant (excluding the matched trades) over the review period was approximately $20,272 and the average sales size of Novena was approximately $11,262."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This was computed by taking the $ value of the transactions done on Novena (excluding those of the Suspect?s matched trades) divided by the number of market participants involved in those transactions on a particular day, and averaging it out over the review period."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"? Basically, these two figures represents or gives us an idea of the average size of transaction per market participant over that period."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The significance of the $?value of matched trades done by the Suspect must be considered in relation to the transactional liquidity of Novena.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"if, for example, a value of $39,022 was compared against the transactional liquidity of the stock DBS Group Holdings, which during the same period saw an average daily value of $37.8 million worth of stock traded, it must be concluded that the value of the matched trades is not significant in relation to the overall volume of DBS."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In this particular case, however, we see that the value of matched trades is significant when compared to the average purchase and sales value per market participant in Novena during that period ."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The average value of matched trades, at $39,022, is not only significant in terms of size, but also exceeds the average purchase and sales size per market participant in Novena of $20,272 and $11,262 respectively."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The reasoning behind the comparison of these figures is as follows:
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The average purchase and sales volume per market participant gives us an idea of the quantity of Novena shares in $?value that an ""average"" investor in Novena during that period would look to buy or sell."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This ""average"" investor would look at the market volume of Novena to assess if there would be any liquidity constraints (that is, constraints pertaining to difficulty in fulfilling an order due to insufficient transactional liquidity) either current or potential (as in difficulty with transactional liquidity when it comes to selling the shares)."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"He/she would be lulled into a false notion that Novena shares trade more actively than in reality (the inflated volume caused by the presence and relatively large volume of matched trades) and it is reasonable to assume that the he/she reached this conclusion because of the relatively large size of the matched trades, in relation to the size of the average purchase or sale."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Further observations to support the significance of the Suspect?s matched trades: Over the period 3 June 2002 to 9 September 2003,There were 35 days and 13§ days respectively in which the value of matched trades exceeded the laverage purchase size and sales size per market participant in Novena."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There were 42 days in which the Suspect?s matched trades accounted for 130% of the market volume in Novena.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There were at least 96 days in which the Suspect?s matched trades accounted for more than 50% of the market volume in Novena. 3.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The frequency with which these matched trades was detected also supports the case for the creation of a false or misleading appearance of active trading.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This situation was certainly not a case of sporadic matching of trades.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Over the period 3 June 2002 to 9 September 2003, there were 322 market days, of whish the number of days in which there was transacted volume in Novena was 155 days."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Number of days a specific event happened vs number of days suspects traded over the review period,"Matched trades, involving the accounts of Tay, Teo, Chan and Chow was observed in 112 days out of these 165 days ? a frequency ratio of 68%."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The: Lenthy Duration through which a Combination of these Factors was Observed.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The presence, frequency and significant size of the Suspect?s matched trades provides a basis for an opinion a the creation of an appearance of active trading."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The prevalence of this observation over a prolonged period further reinforces the creation of an appearance of active trading.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Again, this was no sporadic or isolated occurrence of matched trades."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The pattern shows not only the presence of matched trades, but matched trades on a significant and large scale (within the context of Novena?s normal trading volume during that period), occuring frequently and over a prolonged period."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The pattern of matched trades executed by the Suspect was observed between 3 June 2002 through till 9 September 2003 ? a period of 15 months.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Do the trades reflect an intention to rollover trades, ie extend the setilement period?|I in such a scenario, the Suspect intends to ""own"" a certain quantity of Novena shares."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"He does not have the capital to fund the purchase, hence he embarks on this strategy of rolling over the trade."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,He does this by purchasing X number of Novena shares in the account of Person A.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"When the time comes to settle the purchase transaction (within T+7 days), the Suspect sells the holdings under Person A to another account he controls under"
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Person B. This way, the Suspect retains economic ownership of X quantity of Novena shares."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"There is no capital outlay involved, and he only bears the 2?way transaction costs, as well as the net proceeds (ie sales less purchase)."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,He repeats this sequence when the next settlement period is due.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This goes on, until the original rationale for owning the Novena shares in the first instance is no longer valid or has met its objective."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"in most cases, the underlying objective or rationale for wanting to own the shares in the first instance is a profit?related motive."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The action of closing out a long position within the settlement period (otherwise known as contra?trading) is to avoid the associated capital outlay of the said purchase.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The intention of the initial purchase, however, cannot be determined from this action."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,My opinion is that the pattern of the Suspect?s trading is not inconsistent with that of rolling over trades to extend the settlement period.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"My conclusion is based on the observation that the pattern of trades are mostly contained within a T+7 days time frame, that is, the shares purchased are sold within T+7 days."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The action of rolling over trades serves the intention of delaying settlement and avoiding the capital outlay associated with the purchases of the shares.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"However, It should be noted that in no way is this incompatible with an intention to create an appearance of active trading."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If it is the intention of the Suspect merely to extend the settlement period, then the pattern of matched trades would have to be consistent with such an intention."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There would be 2 factors in this consistency: 1.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The trades would have been fairly lumpy, ie mostly occuring only at 7 day intervals, and; 2."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,? The quantum would also be fairly consistent in each 7?day interval.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"However, it is observed that the pattern of the Suspect?s matched trades does not portray this:"
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There were numerous occasions where the matched trades of the Suspect ran for 3 consecutive days or more.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The most notable instance was the period 12 August 2002 to 11 September 2002
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,when the Suspect?s matched trades occurred on 23 consecutive market days.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This pattern of a prolonged sequence of matched trades on consecutive market days intuitively runs counter to a strategy or intention of rolling over trades, where one would expect to see matched trades interspersed at regular (T+7) day intervals."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The disparity in the daily volume of matched trades is also inconsistent with an intention to merely extend the settlement period.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The volume of daily matched trades ranges from a modest 2,000 shares to a huge 554,000 shares."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,See attach@d chart for the volume dispersion of the Suspect?s daily matched trades.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"With regards to SIA 97 (4): 1 arn of the opinion that the ""rolling over of trades"" [defined as a sequence of repetitive trades involving acquiring and closing of a long position within a settlement period such that there is no cash outlay for the capital value of the transaction, only the net proceeds plus transactions cost is borne], does not rule out the purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance of active trading."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The act of rolling over trades itself does not preclude such a purpose or intention.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This can be highlighted by a simple analogy or example.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Assuming a person has the intention to create a false or misleading appearance of active trading on Counter ABC.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"He could do this via several ways ? one of them would be to buy and sell shares using proxies, and so as to minimise his cash outlay for those trades, he would close out the positions within the settlement period so that he incur only the transaction costs and the net gain/loss."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This method would reduce his financial requirements arising from his trades, but the act does not in any way preclude an intention of creating an dppearance of active trading."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Docs the pattern of transactions of the Suspect suggest an underlying strategy to trade in Novena shares for profit, while avoiding the capital outlay associated with the purchases?"
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,An examination of the economics of the Suspect?s transactions suggest this is not the case.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Choice of Stock to execute strategy: Such a strategy would normally have been employed in a more liquid stock, herice avoiding the need to complicate issues by involving matched trades to such a degree as observed in this case."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Over the review period, the Suspect?s matched trades amounted to 12.788m shares, compared to 4.094m shares (average of buy and sell quantities for cornparison purpose) worth of trades between the Suspect and bona?fide third parties."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,,", the Suspect bought a total of 4,065,000 shares at an average price of $0.3119 from bona fide third parties (""°BF3P""), and sold 104,122,000 shares at an average price of $0.3214 to BF3P. ($ figures include transaction costs.)"
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Profit of the suspects,"Based on a quantity of 4,065,000 shares bought and sold at the average buy/sell prices, the Suspect made a net profit of $38,651."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Profit of the suspects,"This compares to the transaction costs of his matched trades of $38,836, which when subtracted from his earlier net profit of $38,651 results in a net loss of $185."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Suspect trade before and after review period,"Which leaves us with the balance of 57,000 shares (excess quantity sold ? these must have accumulated earlier, prior to the review period) of which the purchase cost is not ascertained."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"But the weight of the argument is not changed ? that with the quantities that was traded by the Suspect (ie purchased and sold), it resulted in a small net loss."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Which then persuades me to believe that a strategy of trading for profit, executed over such a prolonged period, is highly unlikely."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,This point is further reinforced when | analysed the first 3 months of profit and loss of the Suspect?s trades.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"In the first month (June 2002), the Suspect?s trades with BF3P yielded an average purchase price of $0.3393 and an average selling price of $0.3302."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Note that the average selling price is lower than the average purchase price, implying a loss on those amounts bought and actually sold."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"If the first two months are considered (June and July 2002), the average buying price and selling price are $0.3469 and $0.3401 respectively."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"For June to August 2002, his average buying and selling prices were $0.3474 and $0.3440."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"So, for those periods, the ""trading for profit strategy"" did not yield good results as we see that the Suspect is purchasing Novena shares from BF3P at a higher price than he is selling the shares."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,It seems again to me rather unlikely that a rational trader would continue such a trading strategy in the face of such profitless evidence.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"(I use only transactions with BF3P for this part of the analysis because matched trades, by their definition, yield no profit or loss and incur only transaction costs.)"
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Thus, taking into consideration the above factors, | find it very unlikely that the Suspect was engaging in a strategy to trade for profit, while rolling over the trades to avoid the capital outlay associated with such purchases. CONCLUSION"
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"Over the period 3 June 2002 to 9 September 2003, the Suspect, using various securities accounts of 4 proxies, traded in Novena shares."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,His pattern of trading involved matching of trades among accounts he controlled.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"This resulted in creating additional volume in Novena ? giving rise to a false or misleading appearance of active trading in Novena because those trades did not represent ""true"" market transactions in that there was no effective change in control of those shares transacted."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,He engaged in frequent transactions involving matched trades of significant size.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,These actions of his was observed over a prolonged period.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Seen in totality, | conclude that his actions created a false or misleading appearance of active trading in Novena shares."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,I arm of the opinion that the pattern of trading coes not preclude an intention to create a false or misleading appearance of active trading in Novena.
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Specifically, the action of rolling over trades is not incompatible with an intention to create a false or misleading appearance of active trading."
report13.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,I arn of the opinion that the ss ia pattern of trading shows elements which are not consistent with a strategy of trading for profit.

report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Plainly enough it is not the object of the section to outlaw all such transactions.""."
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"With this, Mason, J makes it clear that false does not mean ?artificial but rather ?not true?."
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,in this respect the intention or mens rea behind the transaction is important.

report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"If the real reason was to increase, decrease or stabilize the price or trading volumes of OCBC (F), then given my understanding of Mason J?s words, the transaction was ?not real? and thus false."

report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,I draw your attention to the recent Australian case involving Normura International where it was held that the use to a series of artificial transactions within the context of an arbitrage was not false.
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,But the use of sell orders to specifically depress prices in order to get a higher options value did create a false price in the shares being sold.
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In para 3.1 to 3.4 below, whilst I have some doubts as to whether the reasons given by Goh were the complete reasons, given the actions taken they constitute reasonable reasons."
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,| realize that expert witnesses should not make statements with regards the law but give their opinion about a particular set of facts or developments.
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"However, given the definition of false? being used, I have presumed to use the principle that I must accept Goh?s reasons in the absence of proof of any other alternative intent."
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In para 1.3, I concluded that the wider investment public was unlikely to have acted on or be prejudiced by the increased volume in OCBC (F) shares caused by Goh?s transaction."
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"1.3 and 3.1 to 3.4, it is my opinion the transactions in The Shares, did not create or was unlikely to have created a false appearance of active trading."

report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Thank you for attaching Endresz v Whitehouse for my attention.
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,| have found the case useful in the past.
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,I feel the main and fundamental difference between this case and Goh?s transactions are: a
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,There was clear evidence that Endresz?s needed the price of Emu Hill Gold Mines to rise and stay high in order to get margin financing.
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,From this the court concluded that this and not his stated motive was the primary motive in executing the series of trades in Emu; Endresz would and did benefit from the price rise of Emu Hill Gold Mines; The price and volume of shares traded rose very significantly due to Endresz?s actions; and It was an expert opinion?s view that the substantial rise in the resultant price and volume of Emu shares could and would have affect investor behaviour with respect to Emu shares.
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,With respect to Goh?s trade in The Shares: 3 of 6Private & Confidential ACH Investments Pte Ltd e) ? There is no compelling evidence that Goh needed the price of OCBC (F) to remain high or that this was his primary objective.

report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Goh would have benefited from a sustained rise in OCBC (F) stock but

report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,The said sale and purchase did not involve any change in the beneficial ownership.
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"Whilst understanding the legal distinction, from a practical standpoint I see little difference between The Act and the transaction involving The Shares."
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,If you accept the way I have defined ?false? then The Act was not ?false?.
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"The fact that it was at four price points and done during the trading day, in fact reduces the chance of investors potentially being affected."
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"in other words, the effect, in my opinion, would have been greater if Janvier had transacted all 815,000 at $13.06 ? the weighted average price of The Act."
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,The performance of trading volumes of OCBC (F) in the afternoon ? which saw prices decline very sharply down to a close of $11.70 ? strongly suggests that the then negative investor sentiment was unchanged.
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"In short, it is my opinion that The Act did not created nor was it likely to create a false or misleading appearance of active trading in The Shares."
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,My opinion would change if The Act had been either all transacted at the close of the day or spaced out over a longer period.
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"With respect to the majority of investors, day end prices are far more important than intraday prices."
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,Thus such a large trade done at the market close would have drawn far more attention that one traded at just before 11am in the moming.
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,"On the other hand, if The Act had been over say four market day closes, then strong evidence of an alternative primary motive ? namely to affect an increase in the price of OCBC (F) shares ? would be evident."

report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,He said he preferred to do it by means of a trade.
report14.pdf.txt_sent.csv,,,Given the $1 million limit Goh had to transfer The Shares at no less than $12.89 to meet this criteria.

report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,I believe that Pheim (Malaysia)?s orders were not genuine in the sense that: A genuine buyer would not have bought the Shares at the time Pheim (Malaysia) bought.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Given the way share price data is recorded and used by investors, year end closing prices are particularly important in determining portfolio performances."

report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,Furthermore Pheim (Malaysia) did not buy at the cheapest price during this period (see Point 13(b)) and the bulk of its orders were placed near the close of each day (see Points 13(b) & (c)).
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,This should be contrasted with the careful trades and downward trend in the buying price prior to December 2004.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,A genuine buyer would not have bought the Shares in the manner in which they were bought.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"A genuine buyer of a significant amount of shares, in a thinly traded security, would normally spread their purchases over a longer period of time and over the course of a day so as to minimize the upward impact on the purchase price of the shares and to minimize Share price volatility."

report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,I am of the opinion that Pheim (Malaysia)?s actions caused an upward spike in the price of the Shares during the Relevant Period.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,I am of the opinion that Pheim (Malaysia)?s actions meant its fund did not buy the Shares at the lowest possible price.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,I am of the opinion that Pheim (Malaysia)?s actions increased the Share price volatility of UET and that this increase Share price volatility could or would have been to the detriment to both the fund (increases its portfolio risk profile) and to UET (increases its long term cost of capital).
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,A genuine buyer would not have bought the Shares at the price they were bought.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Given the size of Pheim (Malaysia) trades and the generally thin market liquidity, a genuine buyer of a significant amount of shares, in a thinly traded security, would normally take any opportunity to acquire a large block of shares from another shareholder, either ?off? or ?on? the market, rather than buying from the market as it significantly reduces the risk of the buyer not getting enough shares or paying more for the shares desired."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspects vs total outstanding shares,"Pheim (Malaysia) failed to acquire 207,000 Shares, equivalent to 57.5% of all the Shares acquired by Pheim (Malaysia) during the Relevant Period, from Pheim (Singapore)."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,This failure caused Pheim (Malaysia?s) fund to incur at least 8.8% more cost (see Point 14).
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"I am of the opinion that Pheim (Malaysia)?s actions caused the price of the Share to rise significantly and above what would have been its market or equilibrium price given: Pheim (Malaysia)?s trades, which moved the price from 38 cents to 41 cents and to 45.5 cents over the 3 days in the Relevant period, were executed close to the end of each of the 3 days and especially close on 2 of those days."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,Shares traded by suspect before closing and during pre-close vs full day volume,At the start of the week and on the 27 December 2004 the closing price of the Shares were 38 cents but by the close of the week and on the 31 December 2004 the closing price of the Shares were 44.5 cents or some 17% higher.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Event,,"In the same period the STI rose 0.5% and the sub-industrial index (SESERV), in which UET is classified, rose by 2.1%."

report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,The Closing price of the Shares from IPO to 27 June 2005 During the period before and after the Relevant Period the wider market was generally buoyant and that there was no Share price specific information that would explain why Pheim (Malaysia) had to buy in such a concentrated manner in the last 3 market days of 2004 (see Point 23 and 24).
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,It is my view that no senior fund manager would have genuinely traded in the manner that Pheim (Malaysia) did.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,The patterns of trading clearly indicates motives other that pure legitimate portfolio investment.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Given that I am of the opinion that the Pheim (Malaysia)?s orders were not genuine or legitimate and that the price of the Shares would have been lower if the Pheim (Malaysia) had not given the instructions to purchase the Shares, I am of the opinion that the instructions given by Pheim (Malaysia) to purchase / orders or transactions in the Shares created a false or misleading appearance of the price of the Shares."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Where a broker is asked to trade with ?careful discretion?, what is generally understood by ?careful discretion?"
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,?Careful discretion? is a discretionary order that is given to a broker subject to the condition that the broker executes the order in a ?careful? manner.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,A discretionary order allows the broker to decide when to buy or sell a share and at what price.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,It is an implied term that the broker will do the best for the client.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,Careful in the context of careful discretion requires the broker to act carefully and in practice this means that the broker is to perform no worse than the market average.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"For example if you gave the broker careful discretion to buy 100,000 shares and only 200,000 shares traded on that day with an volume weighted price of say $1.00, then you would not expect the whole of the 100,000 order to have been bought (the broker will continue to work your deal the following day) and you would expect your average price would be $1.00 or less."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,Brokers are not meant to set high closing prices or high prices of any sort when exercising careful discretion.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,Careful discretion is normally given for a wide window of time and may include several Trading Days.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,It is an oxymoron to give a careful discretion order for 10 minutes or even half an hour.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"If the broker in the present case had on the respective days been instructed by the client to carry out the transactions in UET shares with ?careful discretion?, whether the broker exceeded the authority granted to him by purchasing the UET shares in the manner that he did?"
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"As noted in Point 20, it is a nonsense to speak of giving a broker careful discretion when a broker has very little time in which to execute."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"You will note that in Table 4 the longest time provided to the broker was on the 30 December 2004 and was 2 hours and 37 minutes prior to market close, which is a very short time to execute 210,000 shares or more than the total volume of the previous 12 Trading Days prior to the Relevant Period."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,On the other two days the broker was provided 16 minutes and 10 minutes prior to market close.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"As noted in Table 3, the purchases undertaken on behalf of Pheim (Malaysia) drove the price of the Shares: from a day low of 37 cents to a day high of 41 cents and to the day close at 41 cents on the 29 December 2004; from a day low of 40 cents to a day high of 45.5 cents and to day close at 45.5 cents on the 30 December 2004; and from a day low of 35 cents to a day high of 44.5 cents and to the day close at 44.5 cents on the 31 December 2004."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,This is a staggeringly gross breach of a careful discretion order.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,It was a staggeringly gross breach on the 29 December 2004.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The fact that Pheim (Malaysia) allowed it to occur again on the 30 and 31 December 2004 suggests that either the broker and Pheim (Malaysia) shared a different understanding/definition of careful discretion from that of the market or that no careful discretion order was actually given.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Given the market conditions at the material time, what was the degree of impact on the transactions in the UET shares on the price, volume and market of UET shares?"
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,The market conditions for the 3 months prior to and after the Relevant Period were positive.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,Index,"The STI was rising gently and the SESERV sub-industrial sector, that the Shares are classified under, rallied and ?caught up? with the STI during the Relevant Period."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,Chart 2: Performance of the STI and SESERV Indices (indexed on 21 April 2004 at 100)
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,There was not much significant news surrounding the UET in the run up to the Relevant Period.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Attribute,News/annoucement,The announcement in November of the 3rd quarter results showed Q3 net profit after tax of $2.36 million or a rise of 152% over the equivalent 2003 period and an accumulative 9 months net profit after tax of $4.36 million or a rise of 125% over the equivalent 2003 period.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"However, investors knew or ought to have known that UET had a very, very strong Q4 2003."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"In fact the FY2003 full year net profit after tax was $6.52 million and unless there were significant earnings coming in Q4 2004, UET could perform below FY2003."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,And so it proved (FY2004 net profit after tax was $6.2 million).
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"Elsewhere, UET announced the finalization of the acquisition of United Guo Zhen and the winning of another MBR project."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"However, as the acquisition had already been noted by an earlier announcement and UET had stated that United Guo Zhen would make no material impact on the net profits, earnings per share or net tangible assets of UET, the news was unlikely to be impactful."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,"A preview of the Share price The Share and the STI and SESERV Indices for a period of 3 months prior to and after the Relevant Period, shows that the Share started to under-perform the STI and the SESERV Indices from about 28 October 2004 to about the 21 February 2005 except for one noticeable period."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,From Chart 3 it can be seen that the relative performance of the Shares during the Relevant Period was the only serious deviation from what was otherwise a downward sloping trend of underperformance versus the STI.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,The deviation is more significant and more serious when compared to the SESERV sub-industrial index.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,,,Chart 3: Relative performance of UET vs the STI and SESERV Indices (indexed on 21 April 2004)
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"As previously noted in Table 3 and in Points 15 and 16, the impact of Pheim (Malaysia)?s buying was significant in terms of moving the price of the Share upwards."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,A 17% rise in the Share price and in 3 days is significant given that most funds seek low double-digit annual returns.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Share price spike is very significant when the Share price trend is neutral to falling.
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,Share price spike is very significant when a Share is starting to severely underperform the market as a whole (the performances of fund managers are compared to the markets in which they operate).
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"As previously noted in Table 2, Pheim (Malaysia) ?s buying accounted for 59%, 100% and 98% of total traded volumes on the 29, 30 and 31 December 2004."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Given how much Pheim (Malaysia) accounted for, it is difficult to envisage a situation where Pheim (Malaysia) did not have a profound effect on the total traded volume during the Relevant Period."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"The market for the Share, is its price times its total traded volume."
report15.docx.txt_sent.csv,Reason,,"Given that it is my opinion that Pheim (Malaysia) very significantly impacted the price of the Share and had a profound effect on its total traded volume, I must also conclude that Pheim (Malaysia)?s buying during the Relevant Period had a very significant to profound impact on the market for the Shares."
